Question: Kyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50. This is with a 25% discount from the original price. What was the original price of the book ?
Solution:
def solution():
    discounted_price = 19.50
    discount = 0.25  # 25% discount
    original_price = discounted_price / (1 - discount)
    result = original_price
    return result

Question: Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50 ?
Solution:
def solution():
    chicken_meal = 12
    milk_packs = 5
    milk_price = 3
    apples = 4
    apple_price = 1.5
    total_paid = 50

    pizza_price = 8.5

    # Calculate the total cost of all items except pizza
    total_without_pizza = chicken_meal + (milk_packs * milk_price) + (apples * apple_price)

    # Calculate the cost of pizza
    pizza_cost = total_paid - total_without_pizza

    # Calculate the number of boxes of pizza
    num_pizza_boxes = pizza_cost / pizza_price
    result = num_pizza_boxes
    return result

Question: Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. One pair of shorts costs $16.50. One pair of pants costs $22.50 and one pair of shoes costs $42. How many dollars did Mishka spend on all the clothing items ?
Solution:
def solution():
    num_shorts = 3
    shorts_price = 16.5

    num_pants = 3
    pants_price = 22.5

    num_shoes = 3
    shoes_price = 42

    # Calculate the total cost of all shorts
    total_shorts_cost = num_shorts * shorts_price

    # Calculate the total cost of all pants
    total_pants_cost = num_pants * pants_price

    # Calculate the total cost of all shoes
    total_shoes_cost = num_shoes * shoes_price

    # Calculate the total cost of all clothing items
    total_cost = total_shorts_cost + total_pants_cost + total_shoes_cost
    result = total_cost
    return result

Question: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.  She buys cartons of ice cream with 15 servings of ice cream per carton at a cost of $4.00 per carton.  After 60 days, how much will she spend on ice cream ï¼Ÿ
Solution:
def solution():
    num_servings_per_carton = 15
    cost_per_carton = 4.0
    num_days = 60

    # Calculate the total number of servings of ice cream that Cynthia will eat
    total_servings = num_days

    # Calculate the total number of cartons of ice cream that Cynthia will buy
    total_cartons = total_servings / num_servings_per_carton

    # Calculate the total cost of all cartons of ice cream that Cynthia will buy
    total_cost = total_cartons * cost_per_carton
    result = total_cost
    return result
