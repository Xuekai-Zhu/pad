Question: I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters ?
Solution:
def solution():
    orange_drink = 10  # liters of orange drink
    orange_drink_water = (2/3) * orange_drink  # liters of water in orange drink
    pineapple_drink = 15  # liters of pineapple drink
    pineapple_drink_water = (3/5) * pineapple_drink  # liters of water in pineapple drink
    remaining_drink = orange_drink - 1  # liters of orange drink remaining after spilling 1 liter
    remaining_drink_water = (2/3) * remaining_drink  # liters of water in remaining orange drink
    total_drink = remaining_drink + pineapple_drink  # total liters of drink
    total_drink_water = remaining_drink_water + pineapple_drink_water  # total liters of water in the drink

    # Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink
    water_in_24_liters = (total_drink_water / total_drink) * 24
    result = water_in_24_liters
    return result

Question: Raymond and Samantha are cousins. Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha. Raymond had a son at the age of 23. If Samantha is now 31, how many years ago was Raymond's son born ?
Solution:
def solution():
    # Find the Raymond age
    age_Raymond = 31 + 6  

    # Find the number of years ago Raymond's son was born
    years_ago = age_Raymond - 23
    result = years_ago
    return result

def solution():
    # Calculate the total number of DVDs sold by Billy on Tuesday
    total_DVDs = 3 + 2*2 + 0*3  # first 3 customers buy 1 DVD each, next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each, last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs
    result = total_DVDs

    burnt_length = 2 * 4  # the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour
    result = burnt_length
