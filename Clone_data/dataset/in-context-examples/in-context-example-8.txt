Question: Henry made two stops during his 60-mile bike trip. He first stopped after 20 miles. His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. How many miles did he travel between his first and second stops ?
Solution:
def solution():
    total_distance = 60
    first_stop = 20
    second_stop = total_distance - 15

    distance_between_stops = second_stop - first_stop
    result = distance_between_stops
    return result

Question: Gloria is shoe shopping when she comes across a pair of boots that fit her shoe budget. However, she has to choose between the boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the boots. If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other costs twice as much, how many dollars are the boots ?
Solution:
def solution():
    heel1_cost = 33
    heel2_cost = heel1_cost * 2
    heel_total_cost = heel1_cost + heel2_cost
    boot_cost = heel_total_cost + 5
    result = boot_cost
    return result

Solution:
def solution():
    # Define the ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age
    darrell_to_allen_ratio = 7/11

    # Calculate the total age of Darrell and Allen
    total_age = 162

    # Calculate the sum of the ratios in order to find the value of one ratio
    total_ratio = 7 + 11

    # Calculate the value of one ratio
    one_ratio = total_age / total_ratio

    # Calculate Allen's current age
    allen_age = 11 * one_ratio

    # Calculate Allen's age in 10 years
    allen_age_in_10_years = allen_age + 10
    result = allen_age_in_10_years
    return result

Question: Gunter is trying to count the jelly beans in a jar. He asks his friends how many they think are in the jar. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half the first one. A third says 25% more than the first one. What is their average guess ? 
Solution:
def solution():
    # Define the three guesses
    guess1 = 80
    guess2 = 20 + 0.5 * guess1
    guess3 = 1.25 * guess1

    # Calculate the average guess
    average_guess = (guess1 + guess2 + guess3) / 3
    result = average_guess
    return result
