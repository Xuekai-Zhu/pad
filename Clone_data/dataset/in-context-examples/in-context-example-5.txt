Question: Two trains leave San Rafael at the same time. They begin traveling westward, both traveling for 80 miles. The next day, they travel northwards, covering 150 miles. What's the distance covered by each train in the two days ?
Solution:
def solution():
    # Distance covered in the first day
    distance_first_day = 2 * 80  # Two trains each travel 80 miles westward

    # Distance covered in the second day
    distance_second_day = 2 * 150  # Two trains each travel 150 miles northwards

    # Total distance covered by each train in two days
    distance_total = distance_first_day + distance_second_day
    result = distance_total
    return result

Question: Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what's her annual salary ?
Solution:
def solution():
    # Calculate the salary as a teacher
    salary_teacher = 20 * 35 * 50  # $20 per hour, 35 hours per week, 50 weeks per year

    # Calculate the salary as a cheerleading coach
    salary_coach = 30 * 15 * 50  # $30 per hour, 15 hours per week, 50 weeks per year

    # Calculate the total annual salary
    total_salary = salary_teacher + salary_coach
    result = total_salary
    return result

Question: Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast.  How many dozens of eggs will she eat in 4 weeks?
Solution:
def solution():
    eggs_per_omelet = 3  # Claire uses 3 eggs per omelet
    omelets_per_day = 1  # Claire makes 1 omelet per day
    days_per_week = 7  # There are 7 days in a week
    weeks = 4  # Claire wants to know how many dozens of eggs she will eat in 4 weeks

    # Calculate the total number of eggs Claire will eat in 4 weeks
    total_eggs = eggs_per_omelet * omelets_per_day * days_per_week * weeks

    # Convert the total number of eggs to dozens of eggs
    dozens_of_eggs = total_eggs / 12
    result = dozens_of_eggs
    return result

Question: Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail. She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, then another hour to walk the next two miles. If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, what speed (in miles per hour) does she need to walk the remaining distance ?
Solution:
def solution():
    total_distance = 12  # Marissa is hiking a 12-mile trail
    distance_walked = 4 + 2  # Marissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour
    remaining_distance = total_distance - distance_walked  # Marissa has to walk the remaining distance
    remaining_time = (total_distance / 4) - 2  # Marissa has 4 hours to complete the hike, and she has already used 2 hours

    # Calculate the speed Marissa needs to walk the remaining distance
    required_speed = remaining_distance / remaining_time
    result = required_speed
    return result
