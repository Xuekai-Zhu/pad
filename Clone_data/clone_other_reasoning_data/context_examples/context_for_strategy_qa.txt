Question: College commencement ceremonies often happen during the months of December, May, and sometimes June.  Frost isn't uncommon to see during the month of December, as it is the winter. Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?
Solution:
def solution():
    commencement_months = ["December", "May", "June"]
    frost_months = ["December"]
    overlap = [month for month in commencement_months if month in frost_months]
    if overlap:
        result = "yes"
    else:
        result = "no"
    return result

Question: Hydrogen is the first element and has an atomic number of one. To square a number, you multiply it by itself. The Spice Girls has five members. Hydrogen's atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?
Solution:
def solution():
    hydrogen_atomic_number = 1
    spice_girls_members = 5
    hydrogen_squared = hydrogen_atomic_number ** 2
    if hydrogen_squared > spice_girls_members:
        result = "yes"
    else:
        result = "no"
    return result

Question: The density of a raw pear is about 0.59 g/cm^3. The density of water is about 1 g/cm^3. Objects only sink if they are denser than the surrounding fluid. Would a pear sink in water ?
Solution:
def solution():
    # Define the density of a raw pear and the density of water
    pear_density = 0.59
    water_density = 1.0
    # Check if the pear is denser than water
    if pear_density > water_density:
        result = "yes"
    else:
        result = "no"
    return result

Question: Hamsters are prey animals. Prey animals provide food for predators. Do hamsters provide food for any animals ? 
Solution:
def solution():
    are_hamsters_prey = True
    do_prey_provide_food = True
    if are_hamsters_prey and do_prey_provide_food:
        result = "yes"
    else:
        result = "no"
    return result
