def solution():
    
    # Let's assume Colin's current age is x
    # Then Wendy's age in 7 years will be 5x and Colin's age in 25 years will be 1/3 * (5x)
    # We know that in 25 years, Colin's age in 25 years will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so:
    # x + 7 + 25 = 5x + 25
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x = 7
    # Therefore, Colin's current age is 7 years old

    result = 7
    return result
