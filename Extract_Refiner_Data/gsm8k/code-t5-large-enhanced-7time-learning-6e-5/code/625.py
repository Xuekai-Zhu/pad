    # Define the cost of each car and the number of cars sold
    CAR_PRICE = 25000
    NUM_CARS = 10

    # Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars
    total_revenue = CAR_PRICE * NUM_CARS

    # Calculate the amount paid by the company
    company_payment = total_revenue * 0.3

    # Calculate the commission earned by James
    commission = total_revenue * 0.1

    # Calculate the total profit
    total_profit = commission

    # Calculate the total profit
    total_profit = total_profit + total_profit

    # Display the total profit
    result = total_profit
