def solution():
    
    # Let x be the measure of the smallest angle
    # Then the measure of the second angle is 2x and the measure of the third angle is 3x
    # The sum of the three angles is 180 degrees, so we have:
    # x + 2x + 3x = 180
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x = 180 / 3
    # Therefore, the measure of the largest angle is 180 degrees

    result = 180
    return result
