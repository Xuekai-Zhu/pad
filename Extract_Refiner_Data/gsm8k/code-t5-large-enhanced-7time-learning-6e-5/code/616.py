    # Define the number of DVDs played before it breaks
    DVD_BREAK_TIMES = 1000

    # Define the number of DVDs played before it breaks
    num_dvds_played = [56, 135]

    # Calculate the total number of DVDs played before it breaks
    total_num_played = sum(num_dvds_played)

    # Display the total number of DVDs played before it breaks
    result = total_num_played
