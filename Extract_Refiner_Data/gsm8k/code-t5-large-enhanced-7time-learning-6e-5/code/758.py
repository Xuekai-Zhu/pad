def solution():
    
    # Define the initial amount of money Jayden had
    initial_money = 70

    # Calculate the amount of money Jayden's sister Ava gave him
    ava_money = 90 / 2

    # Calculate the total amount of money Jayden has
    total_money = initial_money + ava_money

    # Calculate the amount of money Jayden still needs to buy the camera
    remaining_money = total_money - 200

    # Display the remaining amount of money Jayden needs to buy the camera
    result = remaining_money
