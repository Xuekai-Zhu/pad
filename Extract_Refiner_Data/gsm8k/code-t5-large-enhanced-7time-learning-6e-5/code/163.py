def solution():
    
    # Let's assume Brooke's age is x
    # Seth's age is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth's age is 2x
    # In 2 years, their ages will be 28, so:
    # x + 2x + (2x + 2) = 28
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x + 2 = 28
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # 2x + 2 = 28
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x = 15

    # Therefore, Brooke's age is 15 and Seth's age is 2x = 15
    result = 15
    return result
