def solution():
    
    # Let x be the length of the red rope
    # Then the length of the blue rope is 4x
    # And the length of the yellow rope is x - 7

    # The total length of the 3 ropes is 37 centimeters
    # So we have the equation:
    # x + (4x) + (x - 7) = 37
    # Simplifying the equation, we get:
    # 3x + 7 = 37
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x = 7

    # Therefore, the length of the red rope is 4x = 39 centimeters
    result = 39
    return result
