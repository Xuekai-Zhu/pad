{"output": "Emily is making bead necklaces for her 43 friends. She had 20 beads and she was able to make 5 necklaces. How many beads did each necklace need? To make 5 necklaces, Emily would need to use 5 \u00d7 20 = 100 beads. However, she only had 20 beads to begin with, so she would need to find a way to make up the rest. One possible solution is to use some of the beads she has to make more necklaces, so she could make 6 necklaces with 100 beads each. This would require her to use 6 \u00d7 20 = 120 beads. Each of these 6 necklaces would then need 120\u00f76=20 beads."}

{"output": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds. They put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flower beds did they have? To find the number of flowerbeds, we need to subtract the number of seeds that did not grow into flowers from the total number of seeds planted. In this case, the total number of seeds planted is 36, so the number of flowerbeds that were not planted is 36 - 58 = -24.\n\nSo, they had no flowerbeds."}
{"output": "At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding? In the given information, there are 75 alligators in the cage and 82 snakes in the Zoo. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators are hiding, then we can say that there are 66 alligators that are not hidden."}
{"output": "Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow? If 15 seeds grow into flowers in each flower bed, then they will grow 55 flowers total. If only 60 seeds grow into flowers, then they will not grow any more flowers."}
{"output": "Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add? To make a cake, you need to add sugar in a ratio of 3:1 sugar to flour. So, if she has already added 4 cups of sugar, she will need to add 1 cup of sugar per cup of flour she has used.\n\nSo, if she has used 4 cups of flour, she will need to add 1 cup of sugar to get the total amount of sugar she needs to add to the recipe (7 cups + 1 cup = 8 cups)."}
{"output": "The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper. How far did the frog jump? To solve this problem, we can use the following\u516c\u5f0f:\n\ndistance = (total distance - difference) x 2\n\nwhere distance is the distance the grasshopper jump, total distance is the sum of the distances the grasshopper and frog jump, and difference is the difference between the two distances.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\ndistance = 13 inches\ntotal distance = 13 inches + 2 inches = 15 inches\n\nDifference = 13 inches - 15 inches = 2 inches\n\nWe can use this\u516c\u5f0f to solve for the frog's jump:\n\ndistance = (total distance - difference) x 2\ndistance = 15 inches - 2 inches x 2\ndistance = 15 inches - 4 inches\ndistance = 11 inches\n\nTherefore, the frog jump 11 inches."}
