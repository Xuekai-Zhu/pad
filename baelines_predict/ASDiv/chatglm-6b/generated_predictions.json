{"output": "Lizzie lives in a very big and polluted city. Being an advocate for the environment, she organized a cleanup drive to help reduce the pollution. They started by cleaning the rivers that flow through and around the city. If her group was able to collect 387 pounds of garbage and another group gathered 39 pounds less than Lizzie's group,how much garbage were the two groups able to gather? Let the amount of garbage collected by the first group be x pounds. Then, the amount of garbage collected by the second group would be x - 39 pounds.\n\nAccording to the\u9898\u610f, the total amount of garbage collected by both groups is 387 pounds. Therefore, we can use the following equation to find out how much garbage was collected by each group:\n\nx + (x - 39) = 387\n\n\u89e3\u65b9\u7a0b\u53ef\u5f97:\n\n2x - 39 = 387\n\n2x = 387 + 39\n\n2x = 396\n\nx = 198\n\n\u56e0\u6b64,\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ec4\u6536\u96c6\u4e86198\u78c5\u5783\u573e,\u7b2c\u4e8c\u7ec4\u6536\u96c6\u4e86196\u78c5\u5783\u573e\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5,\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7ec4"}

If Lizzie's group covered 250 square feet of land and the other group covered 265,how many more square feet of land remains to be cleaned if there is total of 900 square feet of land? If Lizzie's group covers 250 square feet of land and the other group covers 265 square feet of land, then the total area of land covered is 250 + 265 = 515 square feet.\n\nIf there is a total of 900 square feet of land, then the difference between the areas of the two groups is 900 - 515 = 385 square feet.\n\nTo find how many more square feet of land remains to be cleaned, we need to find the total area of the remaining land. This is 515 + x square feet, where x is the additional amount of square feet needed to clean.\n\nTo find x, we can use the formula for the area of a square:\n\nA ="}
{"output": "The two groups will also collect garbage from all the 453 houses in the city. If Lizzie's group covered 238 houses while the other group covered 190,how many more houses remain? To find the number of houses that remain, we need to subtract the number of houses covered by Lizzie's group from the number of houses covered by the other group.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n-    Lizzie's group covered 238 houses\n-   The other group covered 190 houses\n-   453 houses remain\n\nTo subtract the number of houses covered by Lizzie's group, we can simply multiply 238 by 453 to get the number of houses that remain:\n\n238 * 453 = 9,412\n\nSo, 9,412 houses remain after the two groups collect garbage from all 453 houses."}

If Lizzie's group is composed of 54 people and they have 17 more members than the other group, how many people are working together to clean the city?\n\nTo find the number of people working together to clean the city, you can add the number of people in each group together to get the total number of people working together. In this case, the total number of people working together is 54 + 17 = 61.\n\nSo, 61 people are working together to clean the city."}
{"output": "Finally, they had to roam around 169 factories to make sure they are throwing their wastes properly. If their group went to 69 factories and the second went to 52,how many factories remain unchecked? To find the number of factories remaining unchecked, we need to find the number of factories that were not visited by either the group or the second group. In this case, we know that the group went to 69 factories and the second went to 52.\n\nSo, the number of factories remaining unchecked is the difference between the number of factories visited by the group and the number of factories visited by the second group:\n\n69 - 52 = 17\n\nTherefore, there are 17 factories remaining unchecked."}

If his sister prepared 25 mini cupcakes and his mother prepared 30,how many did his grandmother prepare if they have a total of 100 cupcakes? If his sister prepared 25 mini cupcakes and his mother prepared 30 cupcakes, then the total number of cupcakes prepared by the family is 65. If the family has a total of 100 cupcakes, then his grandmother would have prepared 10 - 65 = 15 cupcakes."}
{"output": "They also prepared some chips. If he prepared 350 grams of chips and his father prepared 268 grams,how much chips should his brother prepare if they are to have 800 grams of chips? If he prepared 350 grams of chips and his father prepared 268 grams of chips, then it means that the total amount of chips prepared by both of them is 800 grams.\n\nTo find out how much chips his brother should prepare, we can use the ratio of the amounts of chips prepared by each person. Since he prepared more chips than his father did, his brother should prepare 800 grams \u00f7 350 grams = 2.45 chips.\n\nTherefore, if they are to have 800 grams of chips, his brother should prepare 2.45 chips or 24.50 grams of chips."}

His sister bought 48 slices of pizza and his brother bought 48 as well.How many slices of pizza do they have for their neighbors if the family already ate 27 slices? If the family already ate 27 slices of pizza, then they would not have any more slices to share with their neighbors. To determine how many slices of pizza they would have for their neighbors, we need to know how many slices they have left over. If they have 48 slices total, and they ate 27 slices, then they have 21 slices left over. To determine how many slices of pizza they would have for their neighbors, we can use this number."}
{"output": "Their neighbors, wanting to welcome them, also brought in some food. If one neighbor brought 75 hotdogs and another neighbor brought 25 less hotdogs than the first one,how many hotdogs were brought by the neighbors in total? One neighbor brought 75 hotdogs, so they alone brought in 75 hotdogs. Another neighbor brought 75 less hotdogs than the first one, so they brought in 75 - 25 = 50 hotdogs.\nSo the total number of hotdogs brought by the neighbors in total is 75 + 50 = 125 hotdogs."}

If they spent $268.00 on food and $118.00 on utensils and other stuff,how much did they spend on drinks? To find the amount of money they spent on drinks, we need to subtract the amount they spent on food from the total amount they spent. Using the information provided, we have:\n\n$268.00 + $118.00 = $486.00 - $268.00 = $118.00\n\nSo they spent $118.00 on drinks. Therefore, they spent $118.00 on drinks and $560.00 - $118.00 = $442.00 on utensils."}

{"output": "The tallest giraffe at the zoo is 96 inches tall. There are 14 adult giraffes at the zoo. The shortest giraffe is 68 inches.How much taller is the bigger giraffe? To find the taller giraffe, we need to find the average height of the 14 giraffes. The average height of 14 giraffes is the sum of the height of all 14 giraffes divided by the number of giraffes, which is 14 x 1 + 68 x 14 / 2 = 96.5 inches.\n\nSince the tall giraffe is 96 inches, and the shortest giraffe is 68 inches, we can say that the taller giraffe is 96 inches - 68 inches = 28 inches.\n\nTherefore, the biggest giraffe is 96 inches - 28 inches = 78 inches tall."}

{"output": "Bob strikes the drums every 9 seconds and the cymbals every 12 seconds. If he just struck both at the same time,how many seconds will pass before he again strikes them at the same time? Bob strikes the drums every 9 seconds and the cymbals every 12 seconds. If he strikes both drums and cymbals at the same time, how many seconds will pass before he again strikes them at the same time?\n\nTo find out, we need to know how long it takes for one strike to occur. The time for one drum strike is 9 seconds, and the time for one cymbal strike is 12 seconds. If both drums and cymbals are struck at the same time, it means that both strikes occur in the same amount of time, which is 9 seconds or 12 seconds.\n\nSo, we can say that one drum strike and one cymbal strike occur in the same amount of time, which is 27 seconds. 27 seconds will pass before Bob strikes them again"}
{"output": "Bill observed two types of birds in the bushes: sparrows and parrots. While the sparrows were in flocks of 13, the parrots were in flocks of 14. If Bill observed the same total number of sparrows and parrots,what is the smallest number of sparrows that he could have observed? If Bill observed the same total number of sparrows and parrots, and the sparrows were in flocks of 13, and the parrots were in flocks of 14, then the total number of birds would be 57.\n\nTo find the smallest number of sparrows that could have been observed, we can start by subtracting the number of parrots from the total number of birds. This would leave us with 57 - 14 = 43 birds.\n\nWe can then use the formula for finding the minimum number of elements in a set, where the elements are represented by the numbers 1 to 57 and the set is {1, 2, 3, ..., 57}:\n\nmin(1, 2, 3, ..., 5"}

Martin is also trying to construct a track for his train but is using track pieces that are 20 inches long.How long will the shortest track be if the track that Melanie builds ends up being the same length as Martin's track? If Melanie's track ends up being the same length as Martin's track, then the total length of the track will be 20 inches + 8 inches = 28 inches.\n\nTo find the shortest track, we can minimize the total length. To do this, we can start by subtracting the length of Melanie's pieces from the total length:\n\n28 inches - 8 inches = 20 inches\n\nNext, we can add the length of Martin's pieces:\n\n20 inches + 20 inches = 40 inches\n\nFinally, we can subtract the length of Melanie's pieces again:\n\n40 inches - 8 inches = 32 inches\n\nTherefore, the shortest track will be 32 inches long."}

To hold the four carnations and twenty-three roses, you would need at least four vases, but more likely six or seven vases would be needed.\n\nOne way to calculate the number of vases needed is to consider the maximum number of flowers that can be held in a single vase, which is nine. Then, since you have four carnations and twenty-three roses, you would need at least four more vases to hold the remaining flowers.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of vases needed is to consider the average number of flowers per vase. Since the average number of flowers per vase is around 3, you would need at least six vases to hold the four carnations and twenty-three roses.\n\nIn both cases, it is important to note that the number of vases needed will depend on the specific configuration of the flowers and the preferences of the person holding the flowers."}

{"output": "Denise has 210 crayons and 3 blocks. If she shares the crayons among 30 friends,how many crayons does each friend get? To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for finding the number of crayons in a group of n people where each person gets x crayons.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nn = x * (n/x)\n\nIn this case, we know that Denise has 210 crayons and 3 blocks, so we can substitute these values into the formula to find the number of crayons each friend gets:\n\nn = 210 * (30/210) = 3 * (30/210) = 3/7\n\nEach friend will get 3/7 crayons. To find the total number of crayons, we can add the number of crayons Denise has to the total number of crayons each friend will get:\n\n210 + 3/7 = 213/7\n\nThis is equal to 30, so we can replace the 3/7"}

If she shares the bananas among 40 friends, how many bananas does each friend get?\n\nTo determine how many bananas each friend gets, we need to know how many friends there are and how many bananas each friend needs.\n\nThere are 40 friends, so we need to find out how many bananas each friend needs. One way to do this is to use a ratio or\u6bd4\u4f8b method. For example, if each friend needs 1 banana, then the total number of bananas distributed among the 40 friends would be 40 x 1 = 40.\n\nAnother way to do this is to use a formula or algorithm. For example, one formula that can be used to determine the number of bananas each friend gets is:\n\nn_bananas = (total_bananas / friend_count) x friend_count\n\nIn this formula, total_bananas is the total number of bananas"}
