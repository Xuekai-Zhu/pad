def solution():
    
    # Define the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
    efficiency = 10

    # Define the regular gas price per gallon
    regular_price = 3

    # Define the distance between the home and office
    distance_1 = 5
    distance_2 = 5

    # Calculate the total distance to be consumed
    total_distance = distance_1 * 2 + distance_2 * distance_3

    # Calculate the total amount of money consumed per week
    total_money = total_distance * efficiency

    # return the result
    result = total_money
