    # Define the initial amount of money Jayden had
    jayden_money = 70

    # Calculate the amount of money Ava gave Jayden
    ava_money = jayden_money / 2

    # Calculate the total amount of money Jayden has
    total_money = jayden_money + ava_money

    # Calculate the amount of money Jayden still needs to buy the camera
    camera_cost = 200

    # Calculate the amount of money Jayden still needs to buy the camera
    jayden_needed = camera_cost - jayden_money

    # Display the amount of money Jayden still needs to buy the camera
    result = jayden_needed
