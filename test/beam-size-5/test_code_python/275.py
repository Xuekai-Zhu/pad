def solution():
    
    # Let x be Sam's current age
    # Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Sam's current age is x + 6
    # In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years
    # In 9 years, Ruby will be x + 9
    # In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam
    # In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam in 9 years
    # So, x + 9 = 3(x + 9)
    # Solving for x, we get x = 9
    # Therefore, Sam is currently 9 years old

    result = 9
    return result
