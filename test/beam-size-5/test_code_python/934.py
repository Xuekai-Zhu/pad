def solution():
    hourly_rate = 50  # John earned 50 dollars an hour
    weekly_hours = 6  # John worked 6 hours in the week
    gas_cost = 50  # John spends 50 dollars on gas
    deposit = 100  # John wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank
    pencils_bought = 5  # John buys 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each

    # Calculate the total amount John earned in the week
    weekly_earnings = hourly_rate * weekly_hours * weekly_hours

    # Calculate the total amount John spent on gas
    gas_spending = gas_cost

    # Calculate the total amount John spent on pencils
    pencils_cost = pencils_cost * pencils_bought

    # Calculate the remaining amount John can spend on pens
    remaining_amount = weekly_earnings - gas_spending

    # Calculate the number of 25 dollar pens John can buy
