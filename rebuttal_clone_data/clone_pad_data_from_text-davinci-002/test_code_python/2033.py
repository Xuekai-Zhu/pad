Question: A recipe for brownies calls for 1 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of cocoa, 1/2 cup of butter, 2 eggs, and 1 cup of flour.  If you have already used 1/4 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons of cocoa, 1/4 cup of butter, and 1 egg, how much of each of the remaining ingredients do you need?

Solution:
def solution():
    sugar = 1
    cocoa = 1/3
    butter = 1/2
    eggs = 2
    flour = 1
    
    used_sugar = 1/4
    used_cocoa = 3/8
    used_butter = 1/4
    used_eggs = 1/2
    used_flour = 1/2
    
    remaining_sugar = sugar - used_sugar
    remaining_cocoa = cocoa - used_cocoa
    remaining_but

print(solution())
