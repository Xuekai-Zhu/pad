Question: Jennie is training for a marathon.  She runs 12 miles on Monday, 9 miles on Tuesday, and 8 miles on Wednesday.  What is her average number of miles per day?
Solution:
def solution():
    miles_run_monday = 12
    miles_run_tuesday = 9
    miles_run_wednesday = 8
    total_miles_run = miles_run_monday + miles_run_tuesday + miles_run_wednesday
    average_miles_per_day = total_miles_run / 3
    result = average_miles_per_day
    return result

print(solution())
