 Question: At a circus, the clowns, elephants, and trapeze artists all get paid the same hourly wage. 
If the clowns work 3 hours, the elephants work 2 hours, and the trapeze artists work 5 hours, 
how much will the circus have to pay in total for 6 hours of work?
Solution: 
def solution():
    hourly_wage = 10
    clowns_hours = 3
    elephants_hours = 2
    trapeze_artists_hours = 5
    total_hours = clowns_hours + elephants_hours + trapeze_artists_hours
    total_pay = hourly_wage * total_hours
    result = total_pay
    return result

print(solution())
