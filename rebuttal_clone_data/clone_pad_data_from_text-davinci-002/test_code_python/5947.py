Question: Lisa has a vegetable garden with an area of 30 square feet.  If the desired area covered by vegetables is 60%, how many more square feet of vegetables does she need to plant?
Solution: 
def solution():
    total_area = 30
    desired_area_coverage = 60
    desired_area = total_area * (desired_area_coverage / 100)
    needed_area = desired_area - total_area
    result = needed_area
    return result

print(solution())
