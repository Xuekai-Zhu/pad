Question: Conner is putting a new roof on a triangular shaped shed.  The triangle has a base that is 8 feet long and a height of 10 feet.  Conner knows that he needs 3 square feet of roofing material for each foot of the base.  How many square feet of roofing material will Conner need?
Solution:
def solution():
    base_of_triangle = 8
    height_of_triangle = 10
    square_feet_needed = 3
    total_square_feet_needed = base_of_triangle * height_of_triangle * square_feet_needed
    result = total_square_feet_needed
    return result
