    """Sally is selling boxes of crackers for her scout troop's fund-raiser. If she sells 50% more on Sunday than she sold on Saturday, then she'll have sold a total of 150 boxes on the two days. How many boxes did she sell on Saturday?"""
    # Let x be the number of boxes sold on Saturday
    # Then the number of boxes sold on Sunday is 1.5x
    # The total number of boxes sold is x + 1.5x = 2.5x = 150
    # Solving for x, we get x = 60
    x = 60
    
    # Return the number of boxes sold on Saturday
    result = x
