def solution():
    """Amon & Rhonda combined have 215 marbles. If Amon owns 55 marbles more than Rhonda, how many marbles does Rhonda have?"""
    # Let x be the number of marbles Rhonda has
    # Then Amon has x + 55 marbles
    # Together, they have x + x + 55 = 215 marbles
    # Simplifying, we get 2x + 55 = 215
    # Solving for x, we get x = 80

    # Therefore, Rhonda has 80 marbles
    result = 80
