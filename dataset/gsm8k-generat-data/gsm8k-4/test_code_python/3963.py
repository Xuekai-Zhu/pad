def solution():
    """9 years from now, John will be 3 times as old as he was 11 years ago. How old is he now?"""
    # Define John's current age as x
    # 9 years from now, he will be x + 9
    # 11 years ago, he was x - 11
    # So, according to the problem:
    # x + 9 = 3(x - 11)

    # Simplifying the equation:
    # x + 9 = 3x - 33
    # 2x = 42
    # x = 21

    # Therefore, John is currently 21 years old
    result = 21
