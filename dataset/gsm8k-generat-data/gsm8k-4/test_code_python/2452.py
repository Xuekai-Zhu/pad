def solution():
    """Ten more than twice the number of birds on the fence is 50. How many birds are on the fence?"""
    # Let's assume the number of birds on the fence is x
    # Then according to the problem, 10 more than twice the number of birds (2x+10) is equal to 50
    # So we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 50 and solve for x
    x = (50 - 10) / 2
    
    # The number of birds on the fence is x
    result = x
    return result
