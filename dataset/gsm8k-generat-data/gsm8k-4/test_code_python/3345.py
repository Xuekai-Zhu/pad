    """Rica's group won in a dance competition. She got 3/8 of the prize money. From Rica's prize money, she spent 1/5 of it and is now left with $300. How much was the prize money that her group won?"""
    # Let x be the prize money that the group won
    # Rica got 3/8 of the prize money, so her share is (3/8)x
    # Rica spent 1/5 of her share, so the amount she has left is (4/5)(3/8)x = (3/10)x = $300
    # Solving for x: (3/10)x = 300
    # x = 1000
