def solution():
    """Lidia has a collection of books. Her collection is four times bigger than the collection which her friend Susan has. In total Susan and Lidia, both have 3000 books. How many books does Susan have in her collection?"""
    # Let's assume Susan has x books
    # This means Lidia has 4x books
    # Together, they have 3000 books
    # So, x + 4x = 3000
    # This simplifies to 5x = 3000
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 600
    
    # Therefore, Susan has 600 books in her collection
    result = x
    return result
