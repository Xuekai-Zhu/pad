Five song requests are rock music, and song requests for oldies are three less in number than rock requests. Ziggy plays a DJâ€™s choice song half the number of times he plays an oldie. Ziggy also sometimes gets rap song requests. Typically, how many rap songs does Ziggy get requested every night?"""
