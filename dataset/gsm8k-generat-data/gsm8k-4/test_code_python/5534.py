    """Julie wants to give her favorite cousin a $2345 mountain bike for his birthday. So far, she has saved $1500. Since the birthday is still a few weeks away, Julie has time to save even more. She plans on mowing 20 lawns, delivering 600 newspapers, and walking 24 of her neighborsâ€™ dogs. She is paid $20 for each lawn, 40 cents per newspaper, and $15 per dog. After purchasing the bike, how much money will Julie have left?"""
    # Define the cost of the mountain bike and Julie's savings so far
    bike_cost = 2345
    savings = 1500

    # Calculate the earnings from mowing lawns
    lawn_earnings = 20 * 20

    # Calculate the earnings from delivering newspapers
    newspaper_earnings = 0.4 * 600

    # Calculate the earnings from walking dogs
    dog_earnings = 15 * 24

    # Calculate the total earnings
    total_earnings = lawn_earnings + newspaper_earnings + dog_earnings

    # Calculate how much money Julie will have left after purchasing the bike
    remaining_money = total_earnings - (bike_cost - savings)

    # Return the result
    return remaining_money
