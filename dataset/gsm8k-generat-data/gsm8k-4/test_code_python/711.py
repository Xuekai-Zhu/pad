def solution():
    """Alice and Emily are selling oranges at the farmer's market. Alice sold twice as many oranges as Emily did. In total, they sold 180 oranges. How many oranges did Alice sell?"""
    # Let's assume Emily sold x oranges
    # Alice then sold 2*x oranges
    # Total oranges sold = x + 2*x = 3*x

    # Total oranges sold = 180
    # 3*x = 180
    # x = 60

    # Therefore, Emily sold 60 oranges, Alice sold 2*60 = 120 oranges

    result = 120
    return result
