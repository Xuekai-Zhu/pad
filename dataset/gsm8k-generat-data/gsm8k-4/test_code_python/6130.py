def solution():
    """Audrey is 7 years older than Heracles. In 3 years, Audrey will be twice as old as Heracles is now. How old is Heracles now?"""
    # Let's assume that Heracles' age is x
    # Audrey's age will be x + 7
    
    # In 3 years, Audrey will be x + 7 + 3 years old
    # Heracles' age in 3 years will be x + 3
    
    # According to the problem, Audrey will be twice as old as Heracles in 3 years
    # So, x + 7 + 3 = 2(x + 3)
    
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 4
    
    # Heracles' current age is x, which is 4
    result = x
