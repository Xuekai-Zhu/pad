def solution():
    """Martin rings the small bell 4 times more than 1/3 as often as the big bell. If he rings both of them a combined total of 52 times, how many times does he ring the big bell?"""
    # Let x be the number of times Martin rings big bell
    # Then 4 + (1/3)x is the number of times he rings small bell
    # According to the problem, x + 4 + (1/3)x = 52
    # Solving for x gives x = 36

    # Therefore, Martin rings the big bell 36 times
