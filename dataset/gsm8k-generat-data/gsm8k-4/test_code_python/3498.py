def solution():
    """Harry's birthday was three weeks after the closing of the school. His three friends decided to contribute an equal amount of money to throw him a party. Harry added $30 to the contribution, making the total contribution three times as much as Harry contributed. Calculate the total amount of money that each of Harry's friends contributed."""
    # Let x be the amount of money each friend contributed
    # Then 3x is the total contribution, and Harry contributed 3x - 30
    # We know that the total contribution is equal to 4 times x, since there were 4 contributors (including Harry)
    # Therefore, 3x = 4x - 30, which implies x = 30
    # So each friend contributed $30

    result = 30
    return result
