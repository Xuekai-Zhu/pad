    """Jenny had $24 left after spending 3/7 of her money. How much is half of her original amount of money?"""
    # Let x be the original amount of money
    # After spending 3/7 of her money, she has 4/7*x dollars left
    # We know that 4/7*x = 24
    # Solving for x, we get x = 42
    # Half of her original amount of money is 1/2*42 = 21
