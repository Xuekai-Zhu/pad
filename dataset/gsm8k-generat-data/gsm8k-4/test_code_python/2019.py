def solution():
    """The sum of the ages of two friends, Alma and Melina, is twice the total number of points Alma scored in a test. If Melina is three times as old as Alma, and she is 60, calculate Alma's score in the test?"""
    # Let Alma's age be x
    # Melina's age is three times as much as Alma's age, so Melina's age is 3x
    # The sum of their ages is 60, so x + 3x = 60
    # Simplifying, 4x = 60, so Alma's age is x = 15

    # The sum of their ages is twice Alma's score in the test, so Alma's score is (15 + 60)/2 = 37.5

    result = 37.5
