    """Arlene hiked 24 miles on Saturday, carrying a 60-pound backpack. She is exactly 5 feet tall. She spent 6 hours hiking. The temperature during the day was 60 degrees Fahrenheit. What was Arlene's average hiking pace, in miles per hour?"""
    # Define the distance hiked and the time spent hiking
    distance = 24  # miles
    time = 6  # hours

    # Calculate the average hiking pace in miles per hour
    pace = distance / time

    # Return the result
    result = pace
