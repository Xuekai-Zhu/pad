def solution():
    """Jean has three times as much money as Jane. They have a combined total of $76. How much money does Jean have?"""
    # Let's assume Jane has x amount of money
    # Then Jean has 3 times as much = 3x

    # Their total combined money is $76
    # So, x + 3x = 76
    # Solving for x gives us:
    x = 19  # Jane has $19
    # And Jean has 3 times as much = 3*19 = $57

    # Return the amount of money Jean has
    result = 57
    return result
