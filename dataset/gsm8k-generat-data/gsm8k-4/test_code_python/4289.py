She rode her bicycle slowly to the high school, rode four miles around the running track at her faster, race pace, and then rode back home, slowly, on the same route. If her total mileage was 10 miles, how far is it, in miles, from Layla's house to the high school?"""
    # Let x be the distance from Layla's house to the high school
    # She rode x miles to the high school, 4 miles on the running track, and x miles back home
    # Total distance is x + 4 + x = 2x + 4
    # We know that the total mileage was 10, so 2x + 4 = 10
    # Solving for x: 2x = 6 => x = 3

    # The distance from Layla's house to the high school is 3 miles
