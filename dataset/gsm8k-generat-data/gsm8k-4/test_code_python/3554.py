def solution():
    """There are five times as many swordfish as pufferfish in an aquarium exhibit. If there are 90 fish total, how many pufferfish are there?"""
    # Let's assume the number of pufferfish = x
    # Then the number of swordfish = 5x
    # And the total number of fish = x + 5x = 6x
    # We know that the total number of fish is 90, so we can write:
    # 6x = 90
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x = 15
    # Therefore, there are 15 pufferfish in the aquarium exhibit.

    pufferfish = 15
    result = pufferfish
