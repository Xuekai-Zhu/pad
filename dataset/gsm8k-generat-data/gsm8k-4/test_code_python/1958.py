def solution():
    """Prejean's speed in a race was three-quarters that of Rickey. If they both took a total of 70 minutes to run the race, calculate the total number of minutes that Rickey took to finish the race."""
    # Let's assume Rickey's time to finish the race as r 
    # Then Prejean's time to finish the race would be 4/3 * r
    
    # According to the problem, the total time they took to run the race is 70 minutes
    # So we can form the equation, r + 4/3 * r = 70
    # Solving for r, we get r = 42
    
    # Therefore, Rickey took 42 minutes to finish the race
    result = 42
