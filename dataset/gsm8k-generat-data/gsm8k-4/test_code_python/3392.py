def solution():
    """At the museum, Bethany saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits. If she saw 80 paintings total, how many portraits did she see?"""
    # Let's assume that the number of portraits Bethany saw is "x"
    
    # According to the problem, she saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits
    # This means that the number of still lifes she saw is 4x
    
    # We also know that she saw a total of 80 paintings
    # This means that x + 4x = 80
    
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 16
    
    # Therefore, Bethany saw 16 portraits.
    result = x
