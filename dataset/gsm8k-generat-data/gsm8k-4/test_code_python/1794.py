def solution():
    """Joshua and Justin shared $40. Joshua’s share was thrice as much as Justin’s. How much is Joshua's share?"""
    # Let Justin's share be x
    # Joshua's share is 3 times as much as Justin's, which is 3x
    # The sum of their shares is $40, so x + 3x = $40
    # Solving for x, we get x = $10
    # Joshua's share is 3x = $30

    # Calculate Joshua's share
    joshua_share = 30

    result = joshua_share
    return result
