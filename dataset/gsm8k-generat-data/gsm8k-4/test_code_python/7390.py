def solution():
    """Today is my birthday and I'm three times older than I was six years ago. What is my age?"""
    # Let x be the age six years ago. Then, today's age is 3x.
    # We can write an equation using the given information:
    # 3x = x + 6  (since I've aged x years in 6 years)
    # Solving for x, we get x = 3.
    # Therefore, today's age is 3x = 3 * 3 = 9.
    
    # Return the result
    result = 9
    return result
