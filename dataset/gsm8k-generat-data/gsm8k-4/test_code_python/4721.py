def solution():
    """In 6 years, Carla will be 30 years old. The sum of the current ages of Carla and Louis is 55. How old is Louis now?"""
    # Let's start by using algebra to solve for the current ages of Carla and Louis
    # Let c = Carla's current age and l = Louis's current age
    # From the problem, we know that:
    # c + l = 55 (the sum of their current ages)
    # c + 6 = 30 (in 6 years, Carla will be 30)
    # Solving for c in the second equation, we get:
    # c = 30 - 6
    # c = 24
    # Substituting c = 24 into the first equation, we get:
    # 24 + l = 55
    # Solving for l, we get:
    l = 31
    
    # Therefore, Louis is currently 31 years old
    result = l
    return result
