def solution():
    """Brett has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles. He has 5 times as many blue marbles as red marbles. How many red marbles does he have?"""
    # Define the difference between the number of red and blue marbles
    difference = 24

    # Define the ratio of blue to red marbles
    blue_red_ratio = 5

    # Use algebra to solve for the number of red marbles
    # Let x be the number of red marbles
    # Then, the number of blue marbles is x + 24
    # Also, the number of blue marbles is 5 times the number of red marbles: x * 5 = (x + 24)
    # Solving for x, we get x = 6
    red_marbles = 6

    # return the result
    result = red_marbles
