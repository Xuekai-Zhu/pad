def solution():
    # Set up the equation with variables
    # Let x be the number of pencils Sabrina has
    # Justin has 8 more than twice Sabrina's pencils,
    # so Justin has 2x + 8 pencils
    # The total number of pencils they have is 50
    # x + (2x + 8) = 50
    # Simplify and solve for x
    # 3x + 8 = 50
    # 3x = 42
    # x = 14

    # Sabrina has 14 pencils
    sabrina_pencils = 14
    result = sabrina_pencils
    return result
