def solution():
    # Set up the equations based on the given information
    # Let x be the purchase price of the second commodity
    # Then the purchase price of the first commodity is x + 127
    # The total cost of purchasing both commodities is $827
    # Therefore: x + (x + 127) = 827
    # Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 127 = 827
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 350
    # Therefore, the purchase price of the first commodity is x + 127 = 477
    result = 477
    return result
