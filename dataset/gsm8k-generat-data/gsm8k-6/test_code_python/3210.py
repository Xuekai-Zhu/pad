def solution():
    # Let x be the number of phone chargers Anna has
    # Then she has 5x laptop chargers
    # The total number of chargers is 24
    # So we can write an equation: x + 5x = 24
    # Simplifying, we get: 6x = 24
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 4

    # Therefore, Anna has 4 phone chargers
    result = 4
    return result
