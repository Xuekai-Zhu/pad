def solution():
    # Set up the equations based on the conditions given
    # Let x be the first and second numbers in the zip code
    # Then, the third number is 0
    # The fourth number is 2x and the fifth number is 8 - 2x
    # The sum of all numbers is 10, so: x + x + 0 + 2x + (8 - 2x) = 10
    # Simplify: 4x + 8 = 10
    # Solve for x: x = 1

    # Therefore, the zip code is: 11088
    result = 11088
