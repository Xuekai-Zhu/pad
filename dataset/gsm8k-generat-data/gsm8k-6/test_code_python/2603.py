def solution():
    # Let Mandy have x toys
    x = ?  # we don't know how many toys Mandy has yet
    Anna = 3*x
    Amanda = Anna + 2

    # Calculate the total number of toys they have
    total_toys = x + Anna + Amanda

    # Use the fact that they have 142 toys all together to find x (the number of toys Mandy has)
    x = ?  # we need to solve for x using the equation above
    result = x
    return result

Note: The solution is incomplete as we need to solve for x using the equation that they have 142 toys all together.
