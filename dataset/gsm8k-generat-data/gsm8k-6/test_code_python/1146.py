def solution():
    # Calculate the total number of bulbs planted by Jane
    total_bulbs = 20 + 10 + 30 + 90  # Jane planted 20 tulip bulbs, 10 iris bulbs, 30 daffodil bulbs, and 90 crocus bulbs

    # Calculate the amount of money Jane earned
    money_earned = 0.5 * total_bulbs  # Jane's mother agreed to pay $.50 for every flower bulb that Jane planted
    result = money_earned
