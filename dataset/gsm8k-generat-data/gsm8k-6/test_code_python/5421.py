def solution():
    # Set up and solve equation to find cost of dessert
    # x represents the cost of dessert
    # x + 5 represents the cost of entree
    # x + (x + 5) = 23
    # 2x + 5 = 23
    # 2x = 18
    # x = 9
    # Therefore, the cost of dessert is $9 and the cost of entree is $14
    entree_cost = 14
    result = entree_cost
    return result
