def solution():
    # Let x be the distance Hiro walked
    # Rajesh walked 10 km less than 4 times the distance Hiro walked, so Rajesh walked 4x - 10 km
    # Together they walked 25 km, so x + 4x - 10 = 25
    # Simplifying the equation, we get 5x = 35, so x = 7
    # Rajesh walked 4x - 10 = 4(7) - 10 = 18 km
    result = 18
    return result
