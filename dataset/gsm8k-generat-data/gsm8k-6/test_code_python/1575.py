    # Calculate the total amount of wool produced by the sheared sheep
    total_wool = 200 * 10

    # Calculate the total revenue from selling the wool
    total_revenue = total_wool * 20

    # Calculate the profit by subtracting the cost of paying the shearer
    profit = total_revenue - 2000
    result = profit
