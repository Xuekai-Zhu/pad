def solution():
    # Set up the equations based on the given information
    # Let Cooper's age be x
    # Dante's age is twice Cooper's age: 2x
    # Maria's age is one year older than Dante: 2x + 1
    # The sum of their ages is 31: x + 2x + (2x + 1) = 31
    # Simplifying the equation: 5x + 1 = 31 -> 5x = 30 -> x = 6
    # Cooper is 6 years old

    cooper_age = 6
    result = cooper_age
