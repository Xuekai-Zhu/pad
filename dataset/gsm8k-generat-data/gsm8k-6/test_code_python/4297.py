def solution():
    # Calculate the total cost and number of DVDs
    total_cost = 10 * 2 + 5 * 5  # 10 DVDs at $2.00 each and 5 DVDs at $5.00 each
    total_DVDs = 10 + 5  

    # Calculate the average price per DVD
    average_price = total_cost / total_DVDs
    result = average_price
    return result
