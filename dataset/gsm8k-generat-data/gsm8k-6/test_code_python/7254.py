def solution():
    # Use algebra to solve for the number of classical CDs
    # Let x be the number of rock CDs, then x/2 is the number of classical CDs
    # Also, x = number of country CDs - 3 = 23 - 3 = 20
    # So, x/2 = (23-3)/2 = 10
    # Therefore, there are 10 classical CDs in Henry's collection
    result = 10
    return result
