def solution():
    # Calculate the total number of pet owners
    pet_owners = 30 / 0.3  # 30 is 30% of the total number of cat owners

    # Calculate the total number of dog owners
    dog_owners = 0.5 * pet_owners

    # Calculate the total number of citizens
    total_citizens = pet_owners / 0.6

    result = total_citizens
