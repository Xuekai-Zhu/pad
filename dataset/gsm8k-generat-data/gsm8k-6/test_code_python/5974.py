def solution():
    # Let's assume the number of drunk drivers is d
    # Then the number of speeders can be represented as 7d-3
    # We know that the total number of students is 45
    # Therefore, d + (7d-3) = 45
    # Solving for d, we get d = 6

    drunk_drivers = 6
    result = drunk_drivers
    return result
