def solution():
    # Let x be the price of the pants
    # Then the price of the shirt is (3/4)x and the price of the shoe is x + 10
    # The total price is 340, so we can form the equation:
    # x + (3/4)x + (x+10) = 340
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 100
    pants_price = x
    result = pants_price
    return result
