def solution():
    # Let's assume there are x tripodasauruses in the flock
    # Each tripodasaurus has 3 legs and 1 head
    # Therefore, the total number of legs is 3x and the total number of heads is x
    # We know that the total number of legs and heads is given as 20
    # Therefore, we can write an equation: 3x + x = 20
    # Simplifying the equation, we get: 4x = 20 -> x = 5
    # Therefore, there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock
    result = 5
    return result
