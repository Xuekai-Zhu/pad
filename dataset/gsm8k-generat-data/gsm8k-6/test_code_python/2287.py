def solution():
    # Let x be the number of purple cars
    # Then, there are (x+6) red cars and 4(x+6) green cars
    # Total number of cars is x + (x+6) + 4(x+6) = 6x + 30
    # Given that total cars is 312, we have:
    # 6x + 30 = 312
    # 6x = 282
    # x = 47

    result = 47
    return result
