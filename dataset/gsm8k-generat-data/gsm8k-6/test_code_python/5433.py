def solution():
    # Calculate the distance covered by Haley's car
    # Let x be the distance covered in miles
    # Then 4/7 is the ratio of fuel used to distance covered
    # So (4/7) * x = 44
    # Solving for x, we get x = (7/4) * 44 = 77
    distance = (7/4) * 44
    result = distance
    return result
