def solution():
    # Set up equations based on given information
    # Let R = Rebecca's age
    # Then M = R + 2 (Matthew is two years older than Rebecca)
    # And F = M + 4 (Matthew is four years younger than Freddy)
    # Also, R + M + F = 35 (ages of three children add up to 35)
    # Substituting the expressions for M and F:
    # R + (R + 2) + (R + 2 + 4) = 35
    # 3R + 8 = 35
    # 3R = 27
    # R = 9
    # Therefore, Freddy's age is F = R + 2 + 4 = 15

    # Calculate the age of Freddy
    age_Freddy = 15
    result = age_Freddy
    return result
