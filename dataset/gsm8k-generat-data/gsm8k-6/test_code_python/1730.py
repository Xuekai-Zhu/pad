First, let's find the cost of one dozen doughnuts:
- If one dozen costs $8, then one doughnut costs $8/12 = $0.67.

Next, let's find the cost of two dozens:
- Two dozens cost $14.
- Therefore, each dozen costs $7, which means each doughnut costs $7/12 = $0.58.

Now, let's compare buying 3 sets of 2 dozens to buying 6 sets of 1 dozen:
- Buying 3 sets of 2 dozens would cost 3 x $14 = $42.
- Buying 6 sets of 1 dozen would cost 6 x $8 = $48.
- Therefore, you would save $48 - $42 = $6.

So, you would save $6 by buying 3 sets of 2 dozens instead of 6 sets of 1 dozen.
