def solution():
    # Let's assume that Bill had x years of experience 5 years ago.
    # Then Joan had 3x years of experience 5 years ago.
    # Now, Joan has twice as much experience as Bill.
    # So, the equation becomes: 2(x+5) = 3x + 5
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 5
    # Therefore, Bill had 5 years of experience 5 years ago, and now he has 10 years of experience.
    result = 10
    return result
