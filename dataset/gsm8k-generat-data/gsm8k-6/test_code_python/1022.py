def solution():
    # Let's set Leah's age as x
    # Rachel is 4 years older than Leah, so Rachel's age is x + 4
    # The sum of their ages is 34, so: x + (x + 4) = 34
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 15
    # Therefore, Rachel's age is x + 4 = 19
    rachel_age = 19
    result = rachel_age
    return result
