def solution():
    # Calculate the total cost of buying 200 toys
    total_cost = 200 * 20

    # Calculate the revenue from selling 80% of the toys
    revenue = 160 * 30  # 80% of 200 is 160

    # Calculate the difference between the revenue and the cost
    profit = revenue - total_cost
    result = profit
    return result
