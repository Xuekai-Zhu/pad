def solution():
    # Let x be the width of the patio
    # Then, the length will be 4x (since it is four times as long as it is wide)
    # The perimeter of the patio is the sum of all four sides
    # Therefore, 2(x + 4x) = 100  (since there are two sides of each length)
    # Simplifying the equation gives 10x = 100, so x = 10
    # Therefore, the length of the patio is 4x = 40 feet

    length = 40
    result = length
    return result
