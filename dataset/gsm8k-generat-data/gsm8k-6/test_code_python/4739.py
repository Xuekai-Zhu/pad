def solution():
    # Let's set the number of trucks as t and the number of cars as 2t (twice the number of trucks)
    # The total number of vehicles is 300, so t + 2t = 300
    # Combining like terms, we get 3t = 300
    # Solving for t, we get t = 100
    # Therefore, the number of trucks on the highway is 100
    result = 100
    return result
