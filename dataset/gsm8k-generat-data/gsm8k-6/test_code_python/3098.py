def solution():
    # Set up the equation for the sum of the three consecutive integers
    # Let x be the age of the youngest brother
    # Then the ages of the three brothers are x, x+1, x+2
    # The sum of the ages is 96: x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96
    # Simplifying the equation: 3x + 3 = 96
    # Solving for x: x = (96-3)/3 = 31

    youngest_brother_age = 31
    result = youngest_brother_age
