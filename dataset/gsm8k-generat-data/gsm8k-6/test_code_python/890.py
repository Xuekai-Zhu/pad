def solution():
    # Let x be the distance of the second throw
    # Then the distance of the first throw is 2x and the distance of the third throw is 4x
    # We know that x + 2x + 4x = 1050
    # Solving for x, we get x = 150
    # Therefore, the distance of the first throw is 2x = 300 meters
    result = 300
