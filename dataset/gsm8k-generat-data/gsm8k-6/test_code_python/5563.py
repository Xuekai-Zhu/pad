def solution():
    # Let x be the number of citations issued for littering
    # Then, x citations were issued for off-leash dogs as well
    # And, 2x citations were issued for parking fines
    # Total number of citations is 24
    # Therefore, we can write the equation: x + x + 2x = 24
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 6  # number of citations issued for littering
    result = x
    return result
