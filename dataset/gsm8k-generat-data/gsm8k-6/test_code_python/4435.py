def solution():
    # Calculate the total cost of items Steve bought
    total_cost = 3 + 2*3.5 + 4*0.25 + 4*0.5 + x  # x represents the cost of boxes of cookies

    # Since the cost of boxes of cookies is twice as much per box as the gallon of milk, we can write the following equation:
    # x = 2*3 = 6
    # where 3 is the cost of the gallon of milk and x represents the cost of boxes of cookies

    # Now we can substitute x=6 in the total_cost equation and solve for total_cost
    total_cost = 3 + 2*3.5 + 4*0.25 + 4*0.5 + 6
    # Simplifying the expression
    total_cost = 25

    # Therefore, Steve did not spend any more money on boxes of cookies. 
    # The number of boxes of cookies he got is zero (0).
    result = 0
    return result
