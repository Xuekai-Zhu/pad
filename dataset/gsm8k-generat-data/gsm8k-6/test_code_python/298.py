def solution():
    # Let x be the number of sweets on the table at first
    # Jack took half of x and 4 more candies, leaving x/2 - 4 sweets on the table
    # Paul took the remaining x/2 - 4 - 7 = x/2 - 11 sweets
    # So, x/2 - 11 = 0, which implies x = 22
    initial_sweets = 22
    result = initial_sweets
