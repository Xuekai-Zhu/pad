def solution():
    # Let's assume the distance Sam ran in the morning was x miles
    # Sam walked twice the distance he ran in the store, so he walked 2x miles
    # Sam's total distance for walking and running = x + 2x = 3x miles
    # Sam's total distance for walking, running, and biking = 3x + 12 miles = 18 miles
    # Therefore, 3x = 6 miles and x = 2 miles, which is the distance Sam ran in the morning

    result = 2
    return result
