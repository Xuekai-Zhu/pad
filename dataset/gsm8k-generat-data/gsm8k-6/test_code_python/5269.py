    # Calculate the total amount of money given by Luke's mother
    mother_money = 50 + (2 * 20) + (3 * 10)

    # Calculate the total amount of money given by Luke's father
    father_money = (4 * 50) + 20 + 10

    # Calculate the total amount of money given by both parents
    total_money = mother_money + father_money

    # Calculate the school fee
    school_fee = total_money
