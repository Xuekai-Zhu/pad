def solution():
    # Let's assume Sara ate x number of apples
    # Then Ali ate 4x number of apples
    # Their total number of apples is 80, so we can write an equation for x: x + 4x = 80
    # This simplifies to 5x = 80
    # Solving for x: x = 16
    sara_apples = 16
    result = sara_apples
    return result
