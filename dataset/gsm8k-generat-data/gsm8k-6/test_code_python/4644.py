def solution():
    # Let x be the number of gallons of water Roman used
    # Then Remy used 3x+1 gallons of water
    # And together they used x + (3x+1) = 4x+1 gallons of water
    # We know that 4x+1 = 33, so solving for x gives x=8
    # Therefore Remy used 3x+1 = 25 gallons of water
    result = 25
