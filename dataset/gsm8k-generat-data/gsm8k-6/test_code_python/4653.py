def solution():
    # Let's assume the number of cans Rachel brought in to be x
    # Then Jaydon brought in 2x+5 cans
    # And Mark brought in 4(2x+5) = 8x+ 20 cans
    
    # The total number of cans is 135
    # So x + 2x+5 + 8x+20 = 135
    # Solving for x, we get x = 11
    
    # Therefore, Mark brought in 8x+20 = 88+20 = 108 cans
    result = 108
    return result
