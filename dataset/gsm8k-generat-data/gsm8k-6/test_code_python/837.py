def solution():
    # Calculate the number of dogs Mariel is walking
    # Let d be the number of dogs Mariel is walking
    # Each dog has 4 legs, and the other dog walker has 3 dogs with 12 legs
    # The total number of legs tangled up in leashes is 4d + 12
    # We know that 4d + 12 = 36
    # Solving for d, we get d = 6
    num_dogs = 6
    result = num_dogs
