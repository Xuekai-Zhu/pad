def solution():
    # Calculate the distance Mercedes ran
    mercedes_distance = 2 * 7.5  # Mercedes ran twice the distance Jonathan ran

    # Calculate the distance Davonte ran
    davonte_distance = mercedes_distance + 2  # Davonte ran 2 kilometers farther than Mercedes

    # Calculate the total distance Mercedes and Davonte ran
    total_distance = mercedes_distance + davonte_distance

    result = total_distance
