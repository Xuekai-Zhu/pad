def solution():
    # Set up equation for the total cost
    # Let x be the cost of one kid's ticket
    # Then the cost of one adult's ticket is 2x
    # The total number of people is 6 kids + 2 adults = 8 people
    # The total cost is $50
    # So we have: 6x + 2(2x) = 50
    # Simplifying: 10x = 50
    # So x = 5

    result = 5
    return result
