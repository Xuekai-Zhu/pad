def solution():
    # Let x be the number of spots on Phil
    # Then, Bill has one less than twice as many spots as Phil, so he has 2x - 1 spots
    # The total number of spots is 59, so we can write an equation:
    # x + (2x - 1) = 59
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 20
    # Therefore, Bill has 2x - 1 = 39 spots
    result = 39
    return result
