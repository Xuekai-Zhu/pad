There are different ways to approach this problem, depending on how the information is interpreted. Here is one possible solution:

def solution():
    # Calculate the total time Eric needs to remove wallpaper from his dining room
    dining_room_time = 2  # hours to remove wallpaper from 1 wall
    total_dining_room_time = dining_room_time * 4  # 4 walls in the dining room
    
    # Calculate the remaining time Eric needs to remove wallpaper from his living room
    living_room_time = total_dining_room_time  # assume the same amount of time per wall
    total_living_room_time = living_room_time * 4  # 4 walls in the living room
    
    # Calculate the total time Eric needs to remove wallpaper from both rooms
    total_time = total_dining_room_time + total_living_room_time
    
    result = total_time
    return result

Note that this solution assumes that each wall in both rooms has the same amount of wallpaper to remove, and that Eric works at the same pace for each wall. If there are differences in the complexity or size of the walls, or in Eric's efficiency, the solution could be different.
