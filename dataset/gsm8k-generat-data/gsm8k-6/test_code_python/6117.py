def solution():
    # Let x be the number of shark sightings in Daytona Beach
    # Then Cape May has 2x - 8 shark sightings
    # Since the total number of shark sightings is 40:
    # x + (2x - 8) = 40
    # 3x = 48
    # x = 16
    # Thus, Cape May has 2x - 8 = 24 shark sightings
    result = 24
    return result
