def solution():
    # Let x be the cost of jellyfish and y be the cost of eel
    # From the problem, we know that y = 9x and x + y = 200
    # Substituting y = 9x into the second equation gives x + 9x = 200
    # Simplifying the equation yields 10x = 200, so x = 20
    # Therefore, y = 9x = 180
    eel_cost = 180
    return eel_cost
