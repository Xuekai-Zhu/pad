def solution():
    # Let x be the storage space on the second floor
    # Then the storage space on the first floor is 2x
    # The boxes use up 1/4 of the storage space on the second floor
    # So 5000 sq ft = 1/4 * x, which means x = 20000
    # Therefore, the total storage space in the building is 2x + x = 3x = 60000
    # The used storage space is 5000 sq ft
    # Therefore, the remaining storage space is 60000 - 5000 = 55000 sq ft
    result = 55000
    return result
