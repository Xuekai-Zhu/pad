def solution():
    # Let x be the number of times Maurice had ridden before visiting Matt
    # Matt and Maurice rode together 8 times, and Matt rode an additional 16 times
    # The total number of times Matt rode is 3 times the number of times Maurice had ridden before his visit
    # Therefore we can set up the equation 8 + 16 + 3x = 3x + 24
    # Solving for x, we get x = 8
    result = 8
    return result
