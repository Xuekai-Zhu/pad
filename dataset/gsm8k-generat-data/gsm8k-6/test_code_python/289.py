def solution():
    # Let x be the number of Chevys Jim has
    # Then Jim has 2x+3 Fords and 4(2x+3) Buicks
    # The total number of models is x + 2x+3 + 4(2x+3) = 301
    # Simplifying the equation, we get 11x + 15 = 301
    # Solving for x, we get x = 26
    # Therefore, Jim has 2(26)+3 = 55 Fords and 4(2(26)+3) = 118 Buicks

    num_buicks = 118
    result = num_buicks
    return result
