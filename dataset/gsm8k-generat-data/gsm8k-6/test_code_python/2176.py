def solution():
    # Let's assume Maiya's age is x
    # First sister's age is 2x (twice as old as Maiya)
    # First sister is 1 year younger than Maiya, so:
    # 2x = x + 1
    # x = 1 (Maiya's age)
    # Their average age is 5, so:
    # (1 + 2 + sister 3's age) / 3 = 5
    # 3 + sister 3's age = 15
    # sister 3's age = 12

    result = 1  # Maiya's age
    return result
