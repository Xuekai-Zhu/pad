def solution():
    # Let Allen's present age be A and his mother's present age be M
    # Then we have A = M - 25
    # In 3 years, their ages will be (A + 3) and (M + 3)
    # According to the problem, (A + 3) + (M + 3) = 41
    # Substituting A = M - 25, we get M - 22 + M + 3 = 41
    # Simplifying, we get 2M = 60, so M = 30
    # Therefore, Allen's mother's present age is 30 years
    result = 30
