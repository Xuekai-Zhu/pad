def solution():
    # Use algebra to solve for Antoinette's weight
    # Let x be Rupert's weight, then Antoinette's weight is 2x - 7
    # The sum of their weights is 98: x + (2x - 7) = 98
    # Simplifying the equation, we get:
    # 3x = 105
    # x = 35
    # Therefore, Antoinette's weight is 2x - 7 = 63
    result = 63
    return result
