def solution():
    # Set up the problem as a system of two equations in two variables
    # Let x be the amount owned by Ali
    # Then, James owns x + 40
    # The total owned by both together is 250
    # So, we have the system of equations:
    # x + (x + 40) = 250
    # 2x + 40 = 250
    # 2x = 210
    # x = 105
    # Therefore, James owns x + 40 = 145
    amount_owned_by_James = 145
    result = amount_owned_by_James
    return result
