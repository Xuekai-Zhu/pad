def solution():
    # Calculate the total revenue from selling half the acreage
    total_revenue = (200/2) * 200  # selling half of 200 acres at $200 per acre

    # Calculate the total cost of buying and developing the land
    total_cost = 200 * 70  # buying 200 acres at $70 per acre

    # Calculate the profit made by Mike
    profit = total_revenue - total_cost
    result = profit
