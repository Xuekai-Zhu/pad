def solution():
    # Let x be the number of people in the interview room
    # Then the number of people in the waiting room is x + 22
    # When three more people arrive, the number of people in the waiting room becomes x + 22 + 3 = 5x
    # Simplifying the equation, we get 4x = 25
    # Therefore, x = 6.25, which we can round down to 6

    result = 6
    return result
