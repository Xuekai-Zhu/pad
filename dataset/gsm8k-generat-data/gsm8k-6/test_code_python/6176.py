def solution():
    # Let's assume the number of boys as x
    # Then the number of girls will be x + 22
    # Total number of kids signed up = x + (x + 22) = 2x + 22
    # But we know that there are 34 kids signed up
    # So, 2x + 22 = 34
    # Solving the equation for x, we get x = 6
    # Therefore, the number of girls signed up = x + 22 = 6 + 22 = 28
    result = 28
    return result
