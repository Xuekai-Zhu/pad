def solution():
    # Calculate the cost of printing the essay
    essay_cost = 0.10 * 7 * 25

    # Calculate the cost of buying the pens
    pen_cost = 1.50 * 7

    # Calculate the total cost
    total_cost = essay_cost + pen_cost

    # Calculate the amount paid by Jenny
    amount_paid = 2 * 20

    # Calculate the change
    change = amount_paid - total_cost
    result = change
    return result
