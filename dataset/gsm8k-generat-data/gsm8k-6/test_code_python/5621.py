First, we need to find the total number of hours worked by Lawrence in a week:
Total hours = (8 hours/day * 3 days) + (5.5 hours/day * 2 days) = 32 hours

To find how many hours Lawrence would work each day if he worked the same number of hours each day, we divide the total hours by the number of days in a week (7):

Hours worked each day = 32 hours ÷ 7 days ≈ 4.57 hours per day

Therefore, Lawrence would work approximately 4.57 hours each day if he worked the same number of hours each day.
