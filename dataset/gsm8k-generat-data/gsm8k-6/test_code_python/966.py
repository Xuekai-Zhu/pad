def solution():
    # Let's say the number of people at Taylor's party is x.
    # Then the number of people at Ryan's party is 4x.
    # We know that both parties combined had 240 people, so:
    # x + 4x = 240
    # 5x = 240
    # x = 48
    # Therefore, the number of people at Ryan's party is:
    ryan_party = 4 * 48
    result = ryan_party
    return result
