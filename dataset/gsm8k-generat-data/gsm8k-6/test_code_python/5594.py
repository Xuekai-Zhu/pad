def solution():
    # Let's assume Pam's age is p and Rena's age is r
    # According to the first statement, p = 2r
    # In 10 years, Rena's age will be r + 10 and Pam's age will be p + 10
    # According to the second statement, r + 10 = (p + 10) + 5

    # Simplifying the equations, we get:
    # p = 2r
    # r + 10 = p + 15

    # Substituting p = 2r in the second equation, we get:
    # r + 10 = 2r + 15
    # r = 5

    # Therefore, Rena's current age is 5 years and Pam's current age is 2r = 10 years.
    result = 10
    return result
