def solution():
    # Let's use K for Kylie and Y for Kayla 
    # We know that K + Y = 340 and Y = 4K + 10 
    # Substituting Y in terms of K we get K + (4K + 10) = 340 
    # Simplifying the equation we get 5K = 330, therefore K = 66 
    # Now we can find Y as Y = 4(66) + 10 = 274
    kayla_picked = 274
    result = kayla_picked
    return result
