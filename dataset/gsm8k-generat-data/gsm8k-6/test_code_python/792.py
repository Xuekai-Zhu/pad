def solution():
    # Let x be the number of floors in Leeward Center
    # Then the number of floors in Chrysler Building is x + 11
    # Since they have a total of 35 floors, we can write an equation:
    # x + (x + 11) = 35
    # Simplifying the equation, we get:
    # 2x + 11 = 35
    # 2x = 24
    # x = 12

    # Therefore, the number of floors in Chrysler Building is:
    chrysler_floors = 12 + 11
    result = chrysler_floors
    return result
