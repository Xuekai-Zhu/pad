def solution():
    # Let's assume the number of raccoons pepper-sprayed is x
    # Then the number of squirrels pepper-sprayed would be 6x, and the total number of animals would be x + 6x = 7x
    # We know that the total number of animals pepper-sprayed is 84:
    # 7x = 84 => x = 12
    # Therefore, Jason pepper-sprayed 12 raccoons
    result = 12
