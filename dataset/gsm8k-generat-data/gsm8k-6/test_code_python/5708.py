def solution():
    # Let x be the cost of a Reuben sandwich
    # Then the cost of a pastrami sandwich is x + $2

    # Calculate the total earnings from Reubens and Pastrami sandwiches
    total_earnings = (10 * x) + (5 * (x + 2)) = $55

    # Solve for x to find the cost of a Reuben sandwich
    x = 3

    # Calculate the cost of a Pastrami sandwich
    cost_pastrami = x + 2
    result = cost_pastrami
    return result
