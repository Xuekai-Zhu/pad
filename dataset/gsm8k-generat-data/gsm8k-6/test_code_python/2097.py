def solution():
    # Set up the equations based on the given information
    # Let x be the amount of money that Nada has
    # Then Ali has x - 5 and John has 4x
    # The total amount of money they have is x + (x - 5) + 4x = 67
    # Simplifying the equation, we get 6x - 5 = 67
    # Therefore, x = 12 is the amount of money that Nada has
    # Ali has x - 5 = 7 and John has 4x = 48

    # Output the amount of money that John has
    result = 48
    return result
