def solution():
    # Let x be the amount of time Walter spent looking at the seals
    # Then he spent 8x amount of time looking at the penguins
    # And he spent 13 minutes looking at the elephants
    # The total time he spent at the zoo is 2 hours and 10 minutes, or 130 minutes
    # So we have the equation:
    # x + 8x + 13 = 130

    # Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
    x = (130 - 13) / 9
    result = x
    return result
