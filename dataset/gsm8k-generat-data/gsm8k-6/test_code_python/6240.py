    # Set up the equations to solve for their ages
    # Let L be Leonard's age, N be Nina's age, and J be Jerome's age
    # L = N - 4
    # N = 1/2J
    # L + N + J = 36
    # Substitute N and L in terms of J in the third equation
    # (N - 4) + N + 2N = 36
    # 4N = 40 => N = 10
    # So, J = 20 and L = 6
