def solution():
    # Let x be the length of Penny's snake
    # Then Jake's snake is x + 12
    # The sum of the length of the two snakes is 70
    # So we have x + (x + 12) = 70
    # Simplifying and solving for x, we get x = 29
    # Therefore, Jake's snake is x + 12 = 41 inches long
    jake_snake_length = 41
    result = jake_snake_length
