def solution():
    # Let's say Steve has x guitars.
    # Then Barbeck has 2x guitars.
    # Davey has 3 times the number of Barbeck's guitars which is 3*(2x) = 6x guitars.
    # The total number of guitars is x + 2x + 6x = 9x = 27
    # So x = 3, which means Steve has 3 guitars, Barbeck has 6 guitars, and Davey has 18 guitars.

    davey_guitars = 18
    result = davey_guitars
    return result
