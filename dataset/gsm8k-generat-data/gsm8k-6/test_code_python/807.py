def solution():
    # Let's assume David's age as x
    # Yuan's age is 7 years older than David, so Yuan's age is x+7
    # Yuan's age is also twice David's age, so Yuan's age is 2x
    # We can equate the two ages to form an equation: x+7 = 2x
    # Solving the equation gives us x = 7, which is David's age

    david_age = 7
    result = david_age
    return result
