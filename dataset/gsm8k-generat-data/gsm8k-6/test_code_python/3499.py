def solution():
    # Set up the equations
    # Let x be Antonio's age in years
    # Then Isabella's age is 2x
    # In 18 months, Isabella will be 10 years + 1.5 years = 11.5 years old
    # 2x + 1.5 = 11.5
    # 2x = 10
    # x = 5
    
    # Antonio's age in months is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months
    result = 60
