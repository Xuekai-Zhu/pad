def solution():
    # Calculate the number of newspapers Miranda delivers in a week
    miranda_newspapers = 2 * 234  # Miranda delivers twice as many newspapers as Jake

    # Calculate the difference in the number of newspapers delivered by Jake and Miranda in a month
    difference_in_month = (miranda_newspapers - 234) * 4  # a month has four weeks
    result = difference_in_month
    return result
