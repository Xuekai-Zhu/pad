    # Calculate the amount of time Jackson spends studying
    study_time = 1/3 * 9

    # Calculate the number of points Jackson earns by studying
    points = 15 * study_time

    # Add the points earned from studying to his starting grade of 0
    total_grade = points + 0

    result = total_grade
