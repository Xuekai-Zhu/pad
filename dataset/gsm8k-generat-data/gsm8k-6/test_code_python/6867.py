def solution():
    # Calculate the total cost of buying two pairs of socks and one pair of soccer shoes
    total_cost = (2*9.50) + 92  # each pair of socks cost $9.50, and the shoes cost $92

    # Calculate the difference between Jack's budget and the total cost of the items he needs
    difference = total_cost - 40

    result = difference
