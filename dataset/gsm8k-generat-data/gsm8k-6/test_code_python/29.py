def solution():
    # Let x be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income
    # 0.4x is the amount she used to spend on rent and utilities
    # With a $600 increase in her salary, she now spends 0.25x on rent and utilities
    # Setting these equal and solving for x:
    # 0.4x + 600 = 0.25x
    # 0.15x = 600
    # x = 4000
    previous_income = 4000
    result = previous_income
    return result
