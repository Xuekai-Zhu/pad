def solution():
    # Let x be the amount of money Jane has
    # Jean has 3 times as much money as Jane, so Jean has 3x dollars
    # The total amount of money they have is 76 dollars, so we can set up the equation:
    # x + 3x = 76
    # Simplifying this equation, we get:
    # 4x = 76
    # x = 19
    # So Jane has 19 dollars and Jean has 3 times that amount, which is 57 dollars
    result = 57
    return result
