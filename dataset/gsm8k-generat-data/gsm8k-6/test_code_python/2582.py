def solution():
    # Let Markus's grandson's age be x
    # Then Markus's son's age is 2x and Markus's age is 4x
    # The sum of their ages is 140: x + 2x + 4x = 140
    # Simplifying, we get: 7x = 140
    # Therefore, x = 20

    # Markus's grandson is 20 years old
    grandson_age = 20
    result = grandson_age
