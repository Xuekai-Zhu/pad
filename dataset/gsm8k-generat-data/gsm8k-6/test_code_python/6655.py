def solution():
    # Let x be the measure of the smallest angle
    # Then the largest angle is 5x and the middle angle is 3x
    # The sum of the angles is 180 degrees
    # Hence, we have the equation: x + 3x + 5x = 180

    # Solving for x
    9x = 180
    x = 20

    # Therefore, the measure of the smallest angle is 20 degrees
    result = x
    return result
