def solution():
    # Calculate the total number of tickets sold
    total_tickets = 400 + 200

    # Let x be the price of a child's ticket
    # Then the price of an adult ticket is 2x
    # The total amount collected is: 200x + 400(2x) = $16,000
    # Simplifying the equation, we get:
    # 1000x = $16,000
    # x = $16

    # Therefore, the price of an adult ticket is 2*$16 = $32
    result = 32
    return result
