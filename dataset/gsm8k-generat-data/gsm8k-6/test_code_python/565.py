def solution():
    # Set up equations based on given information
    # Let x be the distance Kati drives
    # Michelle drives 3 times the distance Kati drives: 3x
    # Tracy drives 20 more than twice the distance Michelle drives: 2(3x) + 20
    # The total distance is 1000 miles: x + 3x + 2(3x) + 20 = 1000
    # Simplify and solve for x: x = 140
    # Michelle drives 3 times the distance Kati drives: 3(140) = 420
    result = 420
