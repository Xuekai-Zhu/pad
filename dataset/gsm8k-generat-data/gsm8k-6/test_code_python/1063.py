def solution():
    # Let x be the amount of sugar in one cupcake
    # Then the amount of sugar in one layer of cake is also x, since it takes the same amount as a dozen cupcakes
    # We know that a dozen cupcakes equals 12x grams of sugar
    # And that the total amount of sugar used is 720 grams
    # So we can write the equation: 12x + 2x = 720 (for the two layers of cake and dozen cupcakes)
    # Simplifying, we get: 14x = 720
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 51.43 (rounded to two decimal places)
    
    result = 51.43
    return result
