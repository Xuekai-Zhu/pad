This is a problem that involves using algebra to solve for the unknown variable (number of emus). Let e be the number of emus in the flock. Each emu has two legs, so the number of legs in the flock is 2e. Since there are also 60 heads, we know that the total number of legs and heads is 2e + 60.

We can set up an equation to represent this: 2e + 60 = total number of legs and heads. 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 
2e = total number of legs and heads - 60 

To solve for e, we need to know the total number of legs and heads. Since each emu has 2 legs and there are e emus, the total number of legs is 2e. And since each emu has one head, the total number of heads is simply e. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equation and solve for e:

2e = 2e + e - 60 
2e = 3e - 60 
e = 60 

Therefore, there are 60 emus in Farmer Brown's flock.
