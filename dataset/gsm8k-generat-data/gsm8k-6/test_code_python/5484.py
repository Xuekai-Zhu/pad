def solution():
    # Let's assume that the number of red marbles is "x"
    # According to the problem, the number of blue marbles is "x + 24"
    # Also, the number of blue marbles is 5 times the number of red marbles
    # So we can write the equation: x + 24 = 5x
    # Solving for x gives us x = 6
    # Therefore, Brett has 6 red marbles

    result = 6
    return result
