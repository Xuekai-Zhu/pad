def solution():
    # Set up the equation to solve for Mario's age
    # Let x be Maria's age, then Mario's age is x + 1
    # The sum of their ages is 7: x + (x + 1) = 7
    # Simplifying: 2x + 1 = 7
    # Solving for x: x = 3
    # Therefore, Mario's age is x + 1 = 4
    mario_age = 4
    result = mario_age
