def solution():
    # Set up equations for Tamara and Kim's heights
    # Let x be the height of Kim in inches
    # Then Tamara's height is 3x - 4
    # And their combined height is x + (3x - 4) = 4x - 4 = 92
    # Solving for x, we get x = 24
    # So Tamara's height is 3(24) - 4 = 68 inches
    tamara_height = 3*24 - 4
    result = tamara_height
    return result
