def solution():
    # Let's assume the number of green grapes is x
    # Then, the number of red grapes is 7 + 3x
    # And, the number of raspberries is x - 5

    # Total number of fruits is 102
    # So, x + (7 + 3x) + (x - 5) = 102
    # Simplifying the above equation, we get:
    # 5x + 2 = 102
    # Therefore, x = 20

    # Number of red grapes = 7 + 3x = 67
    result = 67
    return result
