def solution():
    # Calculate the total revenue from selling 200 snow cones
    revenue = 200 * 0.75

    # Calculate the total cost of starting and running the snow cone stand
    total_cost = 100 + 75 + 110

    # Calculate Todd's profit after paying back his brother
    profit = revenue - total_cost

    result = profit
