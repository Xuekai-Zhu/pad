def solution():
    # Calculate the total cost of purchasing merchandise
    total_cost = (3 * 5) + (2 * 15) + (5 * 4)  # dolls cost $5 each, clocks cost $15 each, glasses cost $4 each
    # Calculate the total revenue from selling merchandise
    total_revenue = (3 * 5) + (2 * 15) + (5 * 4)  # same pricing as above
    # Calculate the profit made
    profit = total_revenue - total_cost
    result = profit
    return result
