def solution():
    # Calculate the revenue from the customers who bought something
    revenue = 100 * 0.8 * 25  # 80% of the 100 customers bought something at the store that cost $25

    # Calculate the profit from the advertising
    profit = revenue - 1000  # James paid $1000 for the advertising
    result = profit
