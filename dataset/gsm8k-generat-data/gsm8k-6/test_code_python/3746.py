def solution():
    # Let p be the cost of the pen and let c be the cost of the pencil.
    # We know that p + c = 6 and p = 2c
    # Substituting p = 2c in the first equation, we get 2c + c = 6
    # Solving for c, we get c = 2
    # Substituting c = 2 in p = 2c, we get p = 4
    result = 4
    return result
