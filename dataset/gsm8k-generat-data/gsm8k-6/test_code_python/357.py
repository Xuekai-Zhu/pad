def solution():
    # Calculate the number of angelfish Catriona has
    angelfish = 8 + 4  # Catriona has 4 more angelfish than goldfish

    # Calculate the number of guppies Catriona has
    guppies = 2 * angelfish  # Catriona has twice as many guppies as angelfish

    # Calculate the total number of fish Catriona has
    total_fish = 8 + angelfish + guppies

    result = total_fish
