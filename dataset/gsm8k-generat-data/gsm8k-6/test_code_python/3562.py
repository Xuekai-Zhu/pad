def solution():
    # Set up equations using given information
    # Let x be the number of stamps AJ has
    # Then KJ has x/2 stamps
    # And CJ has 2*(x/2) + 5 = x + 5 stamps
    # Total number of stamps = x + x/2 + x + 5 = 930
    # Simplifying and solving for x, we get x = 360
    stamps_AJ = 360
    result = stamps_AJ
