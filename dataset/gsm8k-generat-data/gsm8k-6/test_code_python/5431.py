def solution():
    # Set up the equation using variables
    # Let x be the number of gallons Adhira used
    # Then 4x - 5 is the number of gallons Felicity used
    # Together, they used 30 gallons
    # So x + (4x - 5) = 30
    # Simplifying and solving for x:
    x = 7
    # Therefore, Felicity used 4x - 5 = 23 gallons
    result = 23
    return result
