def solution():
    # Let's assume the number of oranges is x
    # Then the number of apples is 3x (since there are 3 times as many apples as oranges)
    # The total number of fruits is 40, so we can write an equation:
    # x + 3x = 40
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 10
    result = x
    return result
