def solution():
    # Harris has 400g of flour, so total flour is 400g + Traci's flour
    # Each cake needs 100g of flour, so 18 cakes need 1800g of flour
    # Let x be the amount of flour Traci brought from her own house
    # Then, 400g + x = 1800g, so x = 1400g

    result = 1400
    return result
