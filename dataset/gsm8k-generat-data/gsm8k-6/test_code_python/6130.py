def solution():
    # Let's assume Heracles' age as x
    # Then Audrey's age will be x+7
    # According to the statement, in 3 years Audrey will be twice as old as Heracles is now
    # So, x+7+3 = 2x+6
    # Solving for x we get, x=4

    age_Heracles = 4  # Heracles age is 4
    result = age_Heracles
    return result
