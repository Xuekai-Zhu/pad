def solution():
    # Let x be the score of the third bowler
    # Then, the second bowler scored 3x points and the first bowler scored (1/3) * (3x) = x points
    # Therefore, the total score is x + 3x + x = 5x
    # We know that the total score is 810 points, so 5x = 810
    # Solving for x, we get x = 162
    result = 162
    return result
