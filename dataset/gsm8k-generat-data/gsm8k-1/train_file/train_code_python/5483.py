def solution():
    """Brett has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles. He has 5 times as many blue marbles as red marbles. How many red marbles does he have?"""
    # Let's assume the number of red marbles to be "r"
    # Brett has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles
    # So, the number of blue marbles would be "r + 24"
    # Brett has 5 times as many blue marbles as red marbles
    # So, we can write: r + 24 = 5r
    # Solving for "r", we get: r = 6
    result = 6
    return result
