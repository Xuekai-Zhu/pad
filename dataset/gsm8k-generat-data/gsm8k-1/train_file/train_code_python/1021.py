def solution():
    """Rachel is 4 years older than Leah. If the sum of their ages is 34, how old is Rachel?"""
    # Let's use algebra to solve this problem:
    # r = l + 4 (Rachel is 4 years older than Leah)
    # r + l = 34 (The sum of their ages is 34)
    # Substitute the first equation into the second equation:
    # (l + 4) + l = 34
    # 2l + 4 = 34
    # 2l = 30
    # l = 15 (Leah's age)
    # r = l + 4 = 19 (Rachel's age)
    rachel_age = 19
    result = rachel_age
    return result
