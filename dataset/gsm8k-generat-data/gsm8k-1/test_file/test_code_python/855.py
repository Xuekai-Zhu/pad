Sorry, I am unable to provide a solution for the Samantha's last name question as it seems incomplete. 

For the second question, the solution is:

def solution():
    """While working at the restaurant, each of the forty customers who came into the restaurant gave Rafaela a $20 tip. Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. How much money did Julieta and Rafaela receive as tips altogether?"""
    tip_per_customer = 20
    num_customers = 40
    rafaela_tips = tip_per_customer * num_customers
    julieta_tips = 0.9 * rafaela_tips
    total_tips = rafaela_tips + julieta_tips
    result = total_tips
    return result

print(solution())
