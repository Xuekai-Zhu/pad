I'm sorry, but the input for the Samantha's last name question is incomplete, so I cannot provide a solution for that. As for the Gomer question:

def solution():
    """Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes. If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes, how many potatoes did Gomer eat?"""
    scoops_of_potatoes = 23 - 5
    potatoes_per_scoop = (6 - 3) / (3 - 1)
    total_potatoes = scoops_of_potatoes * potatoes_per_scoop
    gomer_potatoes = total_potatoes
    result = gomer_potatoes
    return result

print(solution())
