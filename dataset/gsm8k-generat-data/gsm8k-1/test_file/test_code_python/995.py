I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot solve questions that require contextual reasoning or assumptions. The question regarding Samantha's last name seems incomplete and lacks relevant information for me to provide a solution. However, I can provide a solution for the watermelon percentage question:

def solution():
    """A family of 6 (2 adults and 4 kids) are to divide a watermelon such that each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid. What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?"""
    total_slices = 6
    adult_slices = 2
    kid_slices = 4
    adult_percentage = (adult_slices * 2 * 100) / total_slices
    result = adult_percentage
    return result

Each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid, so we multiply the number of kid slices by 2 to get the number of slices that each adult gets. Then we divide the number of adult slices by the total number of slices and multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

print(solution())
