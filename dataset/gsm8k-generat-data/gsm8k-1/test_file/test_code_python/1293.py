Sorry, I am an AI language model and I cannot provide a solution to the Samantha's last name problem as it is incomplete. There are some missing information in the question.

And for the honey and jam mix problem, here's the solution:

def solution():
    """Tim makes a special honey and jam mix. To make 1 jar of the mixture it takes 2 pounds of passion fruit and 1.5 pounds of jackfruit. It also takes 2 pounds of special honey. The passion fruit costs $6 per pound, the jackfruit is $8 per pound, and the honey is $10 per pound. He sells each jar for $50. How much profit does he make selling 10 jars?"""
    passion_fruit_price = 6
    jackfruit_price = 8
    honey_price = 10
    passion_fruit_weight_per_jar = 2
    jackfruit_weight_per_jar = 1.5
    honey_weight_per_jar = 2
    cost_per_jar = (passion_fruit_weight_per_jar * passion_fruit_price) + (jackfruit_weight_per_jar * jackfruit_price) + (honey_weight_per_jar * honey_price)
    selling_price_per_jar = 50
    profit_per_jar = selling_price_per_jar - cost_per_jar
    total_profit = profit_per_jar * 10
    result = total_profit
    return result

print(solution())
