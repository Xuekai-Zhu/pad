Sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot accurately solve the problem regarding Samantha's last name since the given information is incomplete.

For the second problem, we can define the function like this:

def solution():
    """Two track teams are competing against each other in a 4 by 400 meter relay; a race where each competing team has four members that each run 400 meters, or one lap, around a standard track. One of the two teams is very well-rounded and each of their members will run their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. The other team is less well-rounded; their first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds then each subsequent runner will be 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Using this information, how many seconds will the faster team win by?"""
    team1_time = 4 * 55
    team2_time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 # First runner takes 60 seconds, second 57, third 54 and fourth 51
    difference = team2_time - team1_time
    result = difference
    return result

print(solution())
