For the zebra stripes question:

def solution():
    """Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, a zebra with 36 stripes, and another zebra with half that many stripes. How many stripes do the zebras have on average?"""
    total_stripes = (2 * 17) + 36 + (0.5 * 36)
    num_zebras = 4
    average_stripes = total_stripes / num_zebras
    result = average_stripes
    return result

print(solution())
