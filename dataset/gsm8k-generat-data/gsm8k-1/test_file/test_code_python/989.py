Sorry, I cannot provide a solution to "Question: Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's. Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha's last name?" as it requires additional information about Bobbie's last name.

    """An airport has only 2 planes that fly multiple times a day. Each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between flights to France and flights to Germany. The other plane flies exclusively to Poland, and its 44 trips only amount to half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day. How many flights to France does the first plane take in one day?"""

    total_flights = first_plane_flights + second_plane_flights
    france_flights = (1/4) * first_plane_flights
    result = france_flights
