I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I am not capable of solving open-ended questions or completing tasks that require creative or critical thinking. It seems like the given question is incomplete as Samantha's last name is not specified. Could you please provide more information to solve the question accurately? Also, for the second question, to find the number of dozens of eggs Lori will need, we need to calculate the total number of deviled egg halves she needs to make, which is 16 guests * 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves. Since she needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, she needs 48/2 = 24 whole eggs. As there are 12 eggs in a dozen, Lori needs 24/12 = 2 dozen eggs.
