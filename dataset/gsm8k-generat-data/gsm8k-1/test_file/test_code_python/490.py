Sorry, but it is not possible to provide a solution to the question related to Samantha's last name, as there is not enough information given in the problem that would allow us to determine the length of her name.

Solution:
def solution():
    """9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64" tall. The 10th cheerleader is 60" tall. If they build a human pyramid, where 4 girls are on the bottom, 3 stand on top of the 4, 2 stand on top of the 3 and the shortest girl is at the top, how tall is the human pyramid in feet?"""
    height_bottom = 4 * 64
    height_second_layer = 3 * 64
    height_third_layer = 2 * 64
    height_top = 60
    total_height = height_bottom + height_second_layer + height_third_layer + height_top
    height_feet = total_height / 12
    result = height_feet
    return result

print(solution())
