Unfortunately, there is no solution provided for the Samantha's last name question. Here is a solution for the Prince the butcher question:

def solution():
    """Prince is a butcher. He sells 15kg of meat every hour he works, and he works 10 hours a day. His friend Bill gives him a bull that weighs 750kg. How many days will it take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull?"""
    meat_sold_per_hour = 15
    work_hours_per_day = 10
    bull_weight = 750
    meat_sold_from_bull = bull_weight
    days_to_sell_bull = meat_sold_from_bull / (meat_sold_per_hour * work_hours_per_day)
    result = days_to_sell_bull
    return result

print(solution())
