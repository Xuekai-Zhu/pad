Unfortunately, I cannot solve this question as it requires more information. Specifically, we need to know if the pairs of shoes mentioned are made up of two shoes each (i.e. one pair equals two shoes) or if they refer to five sets of shoes (with each set consisting of one shoe for the left foot and one for the right). We also need clarification on whether the question is asking for the total number of shoes or the number of pairs of shoes Frank will have on Sunday. Please provide more information for me to solve this question accurately.
