def solution():
    """Ariadne has a shop selling hats of two different colors, red and green. Her sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Calculate the total amount she made in two months if in the second month her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month."""
