Sorry, I cannot provide a solution for the Samantha's last name question as there is not enough information provided to solve for the number of letters in Samantha's last name. 

For the Griffin's french fries question:

def solution():
    """Griffin had 24 french fries, but Kyle took 5 of them. Billy took twice as many as Kyle.
    Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the 
    number of fries that Kyle had taken. If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did 
    Ginger give Griffin?"""
    initial_fries = 24
    kyle_taken = 5
    billy_taken = kyle_taken * 2
    ginger_given = 0 # to be solved for
    colby_taken = kyle_taken - 3
    
    # calculate total fries at each step
    after_kyle = initial_fries - kyle_taken
    after_billy = after_kyle - billy_taken
    after_ginger = after_billy + ginger_given
    after_colby = after_ginger - colby_taken
    
    # check if final amount is 27 fries
    if after_colby == 27:
        ginger_given = initial_fries - after_billy - after_colby # solve for number of fries Ginger gave
        
    result = ginger_given
    return result

print(solution())
