Sorry, as an AI language model, I am not able to perform the task of solving a question in Python regarding Samantha's last name. The given information is not sufficient to determine the length of Samantha's last name.

Here's the solution for the following question:
An air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running. The air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, then it was turned up to high for 4 hours. Afterward, it was turned off for 2 hours. How many degrees lower than the starting temperature was the final temperature?

def solution():
    """An air conditioner cools a room 2 degrees an hour on low and 3 degrees an hour on high. The room will warm up at 2 degrees an hour with no air conditioner running.

    cooling_low = 2
    cooling_high = 3
    warming_rate = 2
    low_hours = 3
    high_hours = 4
    off_hours = 2
    starting_temp = 70 #degrees Fahrenheit
    temp_after_low = starting_temp - (cooling_low * low_hours)
    temp_after_high = temp_after_low - (cooling_high * high_hours)
    temp_after_off = temp_after_high + (warming_rate * off_hours)
    total_temp_change = starting_temp - temp_after_off
    result = total_temp_change
    return result

The final temperature is 10 degrees lower than the starting temperature.
