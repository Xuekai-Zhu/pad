As an AI language model, I cannot provide an exact solution to this problem without more information about James' time during the race. However, here is a possible approach:

Let J be James' total time for the race, and let x be his time for the run. Then:

- James' time for the swim is 10% faster than Jon's, so it takes him 0.9*40 = 36 minutes.
- James' time for the bike ride is 5 minutes longer than Jon's, so it takes him 1 hour and 25 minutes.
- Therefore, James' total time for the race is J = 36 + 85 + x = 121 + x.
- If Jon won by 10 minutes, then his total time was J + 10 = 131 minutes.
- Solving for x, we get x = 10 minutes for the run.

Note that this solution assumes that James' pace during the run was the same as Jon's, and that there were no other factors affecting the race outcome. In reality, there could be many variables to consider, such as the terrain, weather conditions, equipment, and athletes' fitness level and strategy.
