Here is the solution for the Diane's number train question:

def solution():
    """Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5 and the resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. What was the final value of the number train?"""
    starting_value = 20
    half_number = starting_value / 2
    numerator = starting_value + half_number
    denominator = 5
    division_result = numerator / denominator
    subtraction_result = starting_value - 12
    final_value = division_result * subtraction_result
    result = final_value
    return result
