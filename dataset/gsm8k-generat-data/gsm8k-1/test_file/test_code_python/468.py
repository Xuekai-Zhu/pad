I am sorry, but I cannot provide a solution to the Samantha's last name problem as it requires additional information that is not included in the prompt.

def solution():
    """Matt wants cookies for a snack, but his dad wants him to eat healthily. He tells Matt he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. If Matt wants to eat five cookies in total, how many carrot sticks does he have to eat?"""
    cookies = 5
    extra_cookies = 2
    total_cookies = cookies - extra_cookies
    carrot_sticks = total_cookies * 2
    result = carrot_sticks
    return result

print(solution())
