Unfortunately, the provided question about Samantha's last name does not provide enough information to solve it mathematically. 

Therefore, here is a solution for the train travel question: 

def solution():
    """A train travels between 3 different cities. It goes 75 miles from the first city to the second city, 100 miles from the second city to the third city, and 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city. It does this trip 3 times a day. The train needs service every 18,000 miles so how many days does it go between services?"""
    distance = 75 + 100 + (75 + 100 - 50) # Total distance of one trip
    total_distance = distance * 3 # Total distance per day
    days_between_servicing = 18000 / total_distance # Days between each service
    result = days_between_servicing
    return result

print(solution())
