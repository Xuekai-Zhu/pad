Regarding the workout routine question:

def solution():
    """After tracking his workout routine for 8 weeks, Josh discovered that he had spent 4 hours working out every week except on some occasions. At one point, he spent 5 hours each for two consecutive weeks. Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week. What is the total number of hours he has spent working out across the 8 weeks?"""
    normal_weekly_hours = 4
    two_consecutive_weeks_hours = 5 * 2
    one_week_hours = 6
    total_hours = (normal_weekly_hours * 8) + two_consecutive_weeks_hours + one_week_hours
    result = total_hours
    return result
