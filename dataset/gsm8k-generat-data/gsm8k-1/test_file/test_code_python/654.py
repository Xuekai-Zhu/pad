I'm sorry, but I cannot solve the Samantha's last name problem as crucial information is missing. Please make sure all details are included in the question prompts.

Regarding Finley's grocery trip question, here's the solution:

def solution():
    """Finley went to the grocery store and bought rice, beans, and pork for use in their home. It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, while beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. If it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, how long in minutes did it take to cook all the food?"""
    rice_cooking_time = 30
    pork_cooking_time = rice_cooking_time + 20
    combined_cooking_time = rice_cooking_time + pork_cooking_time
    beans_cooking_time = combined_cooking_time / 2
    total_cooking_time = rice_cooking_time + beans_cooking_time + pork_cooking_time
    result = total_cooking_time
    return result

print(solution())
