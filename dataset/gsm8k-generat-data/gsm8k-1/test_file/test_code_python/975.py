Since Emil is currently 19 and in 5 years he will be half his dad's age, his dad must be 38. 

To find his brother's current age, we can use algebra. Let x be his brother's current age. 

When Emil turns 24, his brother will be x+5 years old. And we know that Emil will be twice his brother's age at that time: 

2(x+5) = 24 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 7 

So Emil's brother is currently 7 years old. 

Therefore, the sum of his dad and brother's current ages is: 

38 + 7 = 45
