Unfortunately, we cannot provide a solution to the Samantha's last name problem as the given information is insufficient and unclear. 

However, we can provide a solution to the Jame's age problem: 

def solution():
    """Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age. How many years separate the age of the two now?"""
    jame_age_now = 22
    cousin_age_in_8_years = (2 * jame_age_now) - 5
    age_difference_now = cousin_age_in_8_years - jame_age_now - 8
    result = age_difference_now
    return result

print(solution())
