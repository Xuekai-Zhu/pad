Since there are 64 student cars and each car has 4 windows, there are 64*4 = <<64*4=256>>256 student windows in total.
Hannah smashes a quarter of these windows, which is 256/4=<<256/4=64>>64 windows.
Similarly, there are 32 teacher cars and each car has 2 windows, so there are 32*2 = <<32*2=64>>64 teacher windows in total.
Hannah smashes 3/4ths of these windows, which is 64*3/4 = <<64*3/4=48>>48 windows.
Therefore, the total number of windows that Hannah smashes is 64+48 = <<64+48=112>>112 windows. Answer: \boxed{112}.
