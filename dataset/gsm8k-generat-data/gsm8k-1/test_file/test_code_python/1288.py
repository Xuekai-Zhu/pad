I'm sorry, I cannot provide a solution for the question "Samantha's last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie's last name. If Bobbie took two letters off her last name, she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie's. Jamie's full name is Jamie Grey. How many letters are in Samantha's last name?" as it requires additional information that is not provided.

def solution():
    """Jackie grew 3" over the summer. She is now 2" shorter than Anne, who is twice the size of Albert. If Albert is 36" tall, how tall was Jackie before summer?"""
    albert_height = 36
    anne_height = albert_height * 2 + 2
    jackie_height = anne_height - 3
    
    # Convert to inches
    result = jackie_height
    
    return result

print(solution())
