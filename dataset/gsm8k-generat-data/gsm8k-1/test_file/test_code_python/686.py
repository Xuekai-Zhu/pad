Sorry, there is no code provided in this question. To solve this problem:

Assumption:
- One year has 12 months.


Let's first find out how many coins Rong saves in a year:
20 coins/month x 12 months/year = 240 coins/year

Now let's find out how many coins Neil saves per month:
2/5 x 20 coins/month = 8 coins/month

And how many coins Neil saves in a year:
8 coins/month x 12 months/year = 96 coins/year

Now we can find out how many coins they each save in ten years:
Rong: 240 coins/year x 10 years = 2400 coins
Neil: 96 coins/year x 10 years = 960 coins

Finally, we can calculate the total number of coins they have:
2400 coins + 960 coins = 3360 coins

Therefore, they would have 3360 coins saved up after ten years of saving.
