def solution():
    total_height = 112

    # Let's assume Kirill's brother's height is x
    # Kirill's height is then x-14
    # Together, their heights equal 112: x + (x-14) = 112
    # Simplifying, we get: 2x - 14 = 112
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 63

    # Kirill's height is x-14 = 63-14 = 49
    kirill_height = 49
    result = kirill_height
