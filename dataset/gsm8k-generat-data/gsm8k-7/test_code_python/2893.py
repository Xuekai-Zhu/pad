Assuming Raine walks to and from school every day, the total number of steps she takes in a day is:

Total steps per day = 150 steps (to school) + 150 steps (from school) = 300 steps

So in five days, she will take:

Total steps in 5 days = 300 steps/day * 5 days = 1500 steps

Therefore, Raine will take 1500 steps walking to and from school in five days.
