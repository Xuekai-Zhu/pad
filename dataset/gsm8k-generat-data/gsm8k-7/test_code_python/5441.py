def solution():
    total_budget = 1600
    tv_cost = 600

    # Let x be the cost of the computer
    # Then, the cost of the fridge is x + 500

    # The total cost of all items must be equal to the total budget
    # x + (x + 500) + tv_cost = total_budget

    # Simplify the equation
    # 2x + 500 + tv_cost = total_budget
    # 2x + 500 + 600 = 1600
    # 2x = 500

    # Solve for x
    x = 250
    
    result = x
    return result
