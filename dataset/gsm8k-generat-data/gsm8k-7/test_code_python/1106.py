def solution():
    # Let x be the age of the older friend
    # Then the age of the younger friend is x - 2
    # The sum of their ages is 74: x + (x - 2) = 74
    # Simplifying the equation: 2x - 2 = 74
    # Solving for x: x = 38

    # Therefore, the age of the older friend is 38
    result = 38
    return result
