def solution():
    # Let's assume Bill has x years of experience now
    x = 0

    # 5 years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill
    # So 5 years ago, Joan had 3x years of experience and Bill had (x-5) years of experience
    # We can set up an equation for this relationship and solve for x
    # 3x = 2(x-5) + 15
    # 3x = 2x - 10 + 15
    # x = 5

    # So Bill has 5 years of experience now
    result = x
