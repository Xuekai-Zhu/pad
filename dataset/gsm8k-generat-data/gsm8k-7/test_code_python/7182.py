def solution():
    # Let's call the original number "x"
    # According to the problem, we know that:
    # 2x + 5 = (1/2)x + 20

    # We can simplify this equation by subtracting (1/2)x from both sides:
    # 3/2 x + 5 = 20

    # Subtracting 5 from both sides:
    # 3/2 x = 15

    # Multiplying both sides by 2/3:
    # x = 10

    # So the original number is 10
    result = 10
    return result
