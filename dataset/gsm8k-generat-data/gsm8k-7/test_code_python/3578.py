def solution():
    total_dresses = 48
    difference = 18
    # Let x be the number of dresses Ana has
    # Then Lisa has x + 18 dresses
    # The sum of their dresses is 48
    # Therefore, x + (x + 18) = 48
    # Simplifying the equation, we get:
    # 2x + 18 = 48
    # 2x = 30
    # x = 15
    num_dresses_ana = 15
    result = num_dresses_ana
