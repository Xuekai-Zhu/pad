def solution():
    # Let x be the age of Cornelia currently
    # In 10 years, Cornelia's age will be x + 10
    # Kilee is currently 20 years old
    # In 10 years, Kilee's age will be 20 + 10 = 30
    # According to the problem, in 10 years, Cornelia's age will be three times Kilee's age
    # Therefore, we can write the following equation:
    # x + 10 = 3(20 + 10)
    # Simplifying the equation, we get:
    # x + 10 = 90
    # x = 80
    # Therefore, Cornelia is currently 80 years old
    result = 80
    return result
