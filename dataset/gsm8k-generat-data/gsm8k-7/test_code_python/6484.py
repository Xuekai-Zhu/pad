def solution():
    # Let Frank's age be x
    # Then Gabriel's age is x - 3
    # We know that their total age is 17
    # Therefore, x + (x - 3) = 17
    # Simplifying this equation, we get 2x - 3 = 17
    # Adding 3 to both sides, we get 2x = 20
    # Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 10
    # Therefore, Frank's age is 10
    frank_age = 10
    result = frank_age
