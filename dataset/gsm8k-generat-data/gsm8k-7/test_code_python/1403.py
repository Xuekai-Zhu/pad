def solution():
    # Let's call the first and second numbers "x"
    # Then we can write the following equations based on the given information:
    
    # x + x + 0 + 2x + y = 10
    # 2x + y = 10
    
    # x + x + 0 + 2x + y = 10
    # 4x + y = 10
    
    # 4x + y = 10
    # y = 10 - 4x
    
    # 2x + y = 10
    # 2x + (10 - 4x) = 10
    # 2x - 4x = 0
    # x = 0
    
    # Therefore, the first and second numbers are both 0.
    
    # 4x + y = 10
    # 4(0) + y = 10
    # y = 10
    
    # Therefore, the fourth and fifth numbers are 4 and 6 (in any order).
    
    # So the zip code is either 00106 or 00160.
