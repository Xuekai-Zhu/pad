def solution():
    # Let's assume Hezekiah's age as x
    # Ryanne's age will then be x + 7
    # Together their ages equal to 15 years
    # So, x + (x+7) = 15
    # Solving for x, we get x = 4
    # Therefore, Hezekiah is 4 years old

    hezekiah_age = 4
    result = hezekiah_age
    return result
