def solution():
    total_cost = 6
    pen_cost_ratio = 2   # pen costs twice as much as the pencil

    # Let x be the cost of the pencil
    # Then the cost of the pen is 2x
    # The total cost equation becomes:  x + 2x = 6
    # Solving for x gives:  x = 2
    # Therefore, the cost of the pen is: 2 * 2 = 4
    pen_cost = 4
    result = pen_cost
    return result
