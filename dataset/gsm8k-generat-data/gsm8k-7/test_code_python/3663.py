def solution():
    # Let's use variables b for Beth and j for Jan
    # Set up two equations based on the given information
    # b + 35 = 105
    # j - 10 = b
    # Solve for b
    b = 70
    # Substitute b back into the second equation to solve for j
    j = b + 10
    # Calculate the total amount of money they have together
    total_money = b + j
    result = total_money
    return result
