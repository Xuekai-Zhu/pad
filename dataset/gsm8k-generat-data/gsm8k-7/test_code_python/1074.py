Assuming that each tile is a square, and that each tile measures 6 inches by 6 inches, we can calculate the total number of tiles in the bathroom as:

number of tiles = width x length = 10 x 20 = 200

We can then convert this to square feet by multiplying the number of tiles by the area of each tile in square feet:

area in square feet = (number of tiles) x (tile area in square feet) = 200 x (6/12) x (6/12) = 50

Therefore, the square footage of the bathroom is 50 square feet.
