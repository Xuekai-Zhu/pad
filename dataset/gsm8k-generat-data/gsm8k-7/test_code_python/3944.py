def solution():
    combined_height = 120

    # Let Sara's height be x
    # Then Joe's height is 2x + 6
    # We know that their combined height is 120
    # So we can write the equation: x + (2x + 6) = 120
    # Solving for x, we get x = 37
    # So Joe's height is 2(37) + 6 = 80 inches
    joe_height = 2*37 + 6
    result = joe_height
    return result
