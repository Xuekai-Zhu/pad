def solution():
    # Let x be James' age
    # John is 12 years older than James, so John's age is x + 12
    # Tim is 5 years less than twice John's age, so Tim's age is 2(x + 12) - 5
    # If Tim is 79, then 2(x + 12) - 5 = 79
    # Solving for x, we get x = 23, which is James' age

    james_age = 23
    result = james_age
    return result
