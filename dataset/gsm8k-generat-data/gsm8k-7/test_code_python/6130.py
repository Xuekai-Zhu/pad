def solution():
    # Let's assume Heracles' current age is x
    # Then Audrey's age is x + 7
    # In 3 years, Audrey will be x + 7 + 3 = x + 10 years old
    # And Heracles will be x + 3 years old

    # Since Audrey will be twice as old as Heracles is now, we can set up the equation:
    # x + 10 = 2(x + 3)

    # Solving for x:
    # x + 10 = 2x + 6
    # x = 4

    # Therefore, Heracles is currently 4 years old
    result = 4
    return result
