Note: We assume that the train runs every 5 minutes for the entire hour, and that all passengers get off the train and new passengers get on at each stop.

def solution():
    passengers_leaving = 320
    passengers_boarding = 200
    num_passengers_per_train = passengers_leaving + passengers_boarding

    # Calculate the number of trains that arrive in an hour
    num_trains = 60 // 5  # 60 minutes in an hour, train comes every 5 minutes

    # Calculate the total number of passengers that step on and off the train
    total_passengers = num_trains * num_passengers_per_train
    result = total_passengers
    return result
