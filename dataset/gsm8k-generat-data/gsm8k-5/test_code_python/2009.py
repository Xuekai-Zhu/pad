def solution():
    total_members = 110  # Total number of members in the marching band

    # Let x be the number of brass players
    # Then the number of woodwind players is 2x and the number of percussion players is 4(2x) = 8x

    total_players = x + 2x + 8x  # Total number of players
    total_players = 11x  # Total number of players is 11 times the number of brass players

    # Solve for x
    x = total_members / 11
    brass_players = x
    result = brass_players
