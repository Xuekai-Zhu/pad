def solution():
    # Ben's new car cost twice as much as his old car
    # Let the cost of his old car be x
    # Then the cost of his new car is 2x
    # He used $1800 from selling his old car to pay off some of the cost of his new car
    # So his new car cost 2x - 1800 - 2000 = 2x - 3800
    # We know that the cost of his new car is twice the cost of his old car
    # So 2x - 3800 = 2x
    # Solving for x, we get x = 3800
    # Therefore, the cost of his old car was $3800

    result = 3800
    return result
