def solution():
    # Let x be the amount of sugar in one cupcake
    # Then the amount of sugar in one layer of cake is 12x

    # We know that 2 layers of cake + 12 cupcakes = 720 grams
    # Therefore, 2(12x) + 12x = 720
    # Simplifying the equation, we get:
    # 36x = 720
    # x = 20

    # Therefore, one cupcake has 20 grams of sugar
    result = 20
    return result
