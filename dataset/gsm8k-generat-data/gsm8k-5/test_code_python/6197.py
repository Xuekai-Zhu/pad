def solution():
    # We know that the sum of the three numbers is 500
    # We also know that the first number is 200
    # Let's call the second number x and the third number y

    x = 2*y  # The second number is twice the third number

    # We can write an equation to represent the sum of the three numbers
    # 200 + x + y = 500

    # We can substitute the value of x in terms of y
    # 200 + 2y + y = 500

    # Simplifying the equation
    # 3y = 300

    # Solving for y
    y = 100

    result = y
    return result
