def solution():
    # Let's call the total number of books "x"
    # We know that 35% of x are children's books, so the number of children's books is 0.35x
    # We also know that the rest of the books, 65%, are for adults, so the number of adult books is 0.65x
    # We are told that there are 104 adult books, so 0.65x = 104
    # Solving for x, we get x = 160

    total_books = 160
    result = total_books
    return result
