def solution():
    # Let's assume Maria's age is X
    # Then Mario's age will be X+1
    # The sum of their ages is 7, so we can create the equation: X + (X+1) = 7
    # Solving for X, we get X = 3, which is Maria's age
    # Therefore, Mario's age is X+1 = 4
    mario_age = 4
    result = mario_age
    return result
