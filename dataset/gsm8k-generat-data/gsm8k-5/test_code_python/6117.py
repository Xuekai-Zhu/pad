    sightings_DB = x  # Let x be the number of shark sightings in Daytona Beach

    # Calculate the number of shark sightings in Cape May

# We cannot solve this question as there is no information given about the number of shark sightings in Daytona Beach. We need to be given this value or assume a value to solve for the number of shark sightings in Cape May.
