    # Calculate the cost of toys
    toys_cost = 3 * 10  # Nina buys three toys at $10 each

    # Calculate the cost of basketball cards
    cards_cost = 2 * 5  # Nina buys two packs of basketball cards at $5 each

    # Calculate the cost of shirts
    shirts_cost = 5 * 6  # Nina buys five shirts at $6 each

    # Calculate the total cost
    total_cost = toys_cost + cards_cost + shirts_cost
