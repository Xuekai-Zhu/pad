def solution():
    # Let's say Bailey had b rubber bands in the beginning
    # Justine had 10 more than Bailey, so she had b + 10 bands
    # Ylona had 2 more than Justine, so she had (b + 10 + 2) = (b + 12) bands

    # Bailey gives 2 bands each to Justine and Ylona, so he is left with 8 bands
    b - 4 - 2 = 8
    b = 14

    # Ylona had b + 12 bands in the beginning, so she had 26 bands
    ylona_bands = 26
    result = ylona_bands
    return result
