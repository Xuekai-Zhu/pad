def solution():
    # Let's assume there were x sweets on the table at first
    # After Jack took half of them and 4 more, there were (x/2 + 4) sweets left
    # Then Paul took the remaining 7 sweets, so (x/2 + 4) + 7 = x
    # Simplifying the equation, we get x/2 - 3 = 0, so x = 6

    initial_sweets = 6
    result = initial_sweets
