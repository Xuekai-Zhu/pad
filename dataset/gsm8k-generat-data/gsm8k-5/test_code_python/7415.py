def solution():
    # Let x be the time it took Dad to vacuum downstairs
    # Then, it took 2x+5 minutes to vacuum upstairs
    # And x + (2x+5) = 38 (the total time spent vacuuming)
    # Solving for x, we get x = 11
    # So, Dad vacuumed upstairs for 2(11)+5 = 27 minutes
    minutes_upstairs = 27
    result = minutes_upstairs
    return result
