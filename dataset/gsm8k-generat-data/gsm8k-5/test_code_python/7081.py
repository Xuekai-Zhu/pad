    # Calculate the total budget for this year: $6 from last year + $50 given = $56
    total_budget = 6 + 50

    # Calculate the total cost for the school supplies: $13 + $24 = $37
    total_cost = 13 + 24

    # Calculate the remaining budget after purchasing the school supplies
    remaining_budget = total_budget - total_cost
