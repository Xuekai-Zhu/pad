def solution():
    # Let's assume Cooper's age is x
    # Dante's age is twice that of Cooper, so Dante's age is 2x
    # Maria's age is one year older than Dante, so Maria's age is 2x + 1
    # The sum of their ages is 31, so: x + 2x + (2x + 1) = 31
    # Simplifying the equation, we get: 5x + 1 = 31
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 6

    # Therefore, Cooper is 6 years old
    result = 6
