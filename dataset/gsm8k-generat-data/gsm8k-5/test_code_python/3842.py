def solution():
    # Let x be the price of the pants
    # Then the price of the shirt is (3/4)x and the price of the shoe is x + 10

    # The total cost is 340 dollars
    # x + (3/4)x + (x + 10) = 340

    # Simplifying the equation
    # (11/4)x + 10 = 340
    # (11/4)x = 330
    # x = 120

    # Therefore, the price of the pants is 120 dollars
    result = 120
    return result
