def solution():
    # Let x be the purchase price of the first commodity
    # Then the purchase price of the second commodity is (x - $127)
    # The sum of the purchase prices is $827
    # Therefore, x + (x - $127) = $827
    # Simplifying: 2x - $127 = $827
    # 2x = $954
    # x = $477, which is the purchase price of the first commodity

    result = 477
    return result
