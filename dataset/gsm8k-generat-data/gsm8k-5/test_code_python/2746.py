def solution():
    # Let's denote Ben's weight as b
    # Then Al's weight would be b + 25
    # And Carl's weight would be b + 25 + 16 = b + 41

    # We know that Ed is 38 pounds lighter than Al
    # So Al's weight would be Ed + 38 = 146 + 38 = 184

    # Using this information, we can solve for Ben's weight
    # b + 25 = 184
    # b = 159

    # Finally, we can calculate Carl's weight
    # b + 41 = 159 + 41 = 200
    result = 200
