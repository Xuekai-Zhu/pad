def solution():
    # Let x be the number of large animals Loraine made
    # Then Loraine made 3x small animals
    # We can create two equations based on the information given

    # Equation 1: 2 * 3x = 12
    # Solving for x gives us x = 2, which means Loraine made 2 large animals
    # Equation 2: 4x + 2 * 3x = 4 * 2 + 2 * 3 * 2 = 20
    # Loraine used 20 sticks of wax to make all the animals

    result = 20
    return result
