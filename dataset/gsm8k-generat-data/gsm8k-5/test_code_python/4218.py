def solution():
    # Let x be Kirill's height
    # Then Kirill's brother's height is x + 14
    # Together, their heights equal 112: x + (x + 14) = 112
    # Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 14 = 112
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 49

    height_kirill = 49  # Kirill's height is 49 centimeters
    result = height_kirill
    return result
