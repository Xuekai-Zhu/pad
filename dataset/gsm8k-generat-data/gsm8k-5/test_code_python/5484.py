def solution():
    # Let x be the number of red marbles Brett has
    # Then, the number of blue marbles is x + 24
    # And, 5 times the number of red marbles is the number of blue marbles
    # Therefore, we have the equation: 5x = x + 24

    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 6  # Brett has 6 red marbles

    result = x
    return result
