def solution():
    # Let's assume Maiya's age is x
    # Then the first sister's age is 2x (since she is twice as old as Maiya)
    # And the second sister's age is x-1 (since she is 1 year younger than Maiya)

    # We know that the average of their ages is 5, so:
    # (x + 2x + (x-1)) / 3 = 5
    # 4x - 1 = 15
    # 4x = 16
    # x = 4

    # Therefore, Maiya is 4 years old
    result = 4
