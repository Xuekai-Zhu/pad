def solution():
    combined_age = 54  # Sam and Drew have a combined age of 54

    # Let's use variables s and d for Sam's and Drew's age, respectively
    # From the problem, we know that s + d = 54 and s = d/2
    # Substituting the second equation into the first equation yields:
    # d/2 + d = 54
    # Solving for d gives: d = 36, which means that Sam is 18 years old
    d = 36
    s = d/2
    result = s
    return result
