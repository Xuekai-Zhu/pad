def solution():
    # Let x be the distance of Javier's second throw
    # Then, the distance of his first throw is 2x and the distance of his third throw is 4x
    # The sum of all three throws is 2x + x + 4x = 7x = 1050
    x = 150  # Solving for x gives x = 150

    # Therefore, the distance of Javier's first throw is 2x = 300 meters
    result = 300
