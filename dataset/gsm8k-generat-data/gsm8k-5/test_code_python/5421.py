def solution():
    total_cost = 23  # Hannah spends $23 in total
    dessert_cost = x  # Let's call the dessert cost "x"
    entree_cost = dessert_cost + 5  # The entree costs $5 more than the dessert

    # Use the total cost equation to solve for x
    total_cost = dessert_cost + entree_cost
    23 = x + (x+5)
    x = 9  # The dessert costs $9

    # Calculate the entree cost
    entree_cost = dessert_cost + 5
    entree_cost = 9 + 5 = 14

    result = entree_cost
    return result
