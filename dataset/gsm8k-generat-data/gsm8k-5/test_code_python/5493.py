    # Calculate Christina's age in five years
    christina_age_5_years = 80 / 2 - 5

    # Calculate Christina's current age
    christina_age_now = christina_age_5_years - 5

    # Calculate Oscar's age in 15 years
    oscar_age_15_years = (3/5) * christina_age_now + 15

    # Calculate Oscar's current age
    oscar_age_now = oscar_age_15_years - 15
    result = oscar_age_now
