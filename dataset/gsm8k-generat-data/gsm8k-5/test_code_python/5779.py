def solution():
    # Betty has 3 red beads for every 2 blue beads
    # Let's call the number of blue beads "b"
    # Then, the number of red beads is 3/2 times the number of blue beads
    # We know that Betty has 30 red beads, so we can set up the following equation:
    # 30 = (3/2) * b
    # Solving for b, we get:
    blue_beads = 20
    result = blue_beads
    return result
