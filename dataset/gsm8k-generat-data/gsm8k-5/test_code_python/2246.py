def solution():
    # Let x be the lifespan of the bat
    # Then the lifespan of the hamster is x - 6
    # And the lifespan of the frog is 4(x - 6)
    # The sum of the lifespans is 30
    # So we have: x + (x - 6) + 4(x - 6) = 30
    # Simplifying this equation, we get: 6x - 30 = 30
    # And solving for x, we get: x = 10

    # Therefore, the lifespan of the bat is 10 years
    result = 10
    return result
