def solution():
    # Let's assume that Hezekiah's age is x
    # Then Ryanne's age would be x + 7
    # We know that their ages together equal 15 years
    # So x + (x + 7) = 15
    # Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 7 = 15
    # Subtracting 7 from both sides, we get 2x = 8
    # Dividing by 2, we get x = 4

    # Therefore, Hezekiah is 4 years old
    result = 4
