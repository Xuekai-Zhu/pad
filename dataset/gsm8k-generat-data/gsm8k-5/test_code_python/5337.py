def solution():
    # Let E be the number of dollars Evan earned
    # Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan, so Markese earned E - 5 dollars

    # Together they earned $37, so E + (E - 5) = 37
    # Simplifying this equation, we get E = 21

    # Therefore, Evan earned 21 dollars and Markese earned 16 dollars
    markese_earnings = 16
    result = markese_earnings
    return result
