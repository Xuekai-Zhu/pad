def solution():
    # Let's call the number of phone messages "p" and set up the equation
    # for the total number of emails and phone messages.
    # We know that the number of emails is 7 less than 9 times the number of phone messages.
    # So, e = 9p - 7
    # Also, we know that the total number of emails and phone messages is 93.
    # So, e + p = 93
    # We can substitute the first equation into the second equation and solve for p.
    # (9p - 7) + p = 93
    # 10p = 100
    # p = 10
    # Now, we can use the first equation to find the number of emails.
    # e = 9p - 7
    # e = 9(10) - 7
    # e = 83
    result = 83
    return result
