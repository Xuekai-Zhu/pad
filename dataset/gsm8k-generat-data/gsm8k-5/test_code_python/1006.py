Unfortunately, we cannot solve this problem as there is not enough information given. We know that when Jayson is 10, his dad is four times his age, but we don't know Jayson's current age or his dad's current age. We also know that Jayson's mom is two years younger than his dad, but we don't know either of their current ages. Without any additional information, we cannot determine how old Jayson's mom was when he was born.
