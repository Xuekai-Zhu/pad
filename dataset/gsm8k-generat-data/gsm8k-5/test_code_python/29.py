def solution():
    # Let x be Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income
    # 0.4x represents the amount she used to spend on rent and utilities before her salary increase
    # x + 600 represents her new monthly income after the salary increase
    # 0.25(x + 600) represents the amount she currently spends on rent and utilities

    # Set up an equation based on the given information
    # 0.4x = 0.25(x + 600)
    # 0.4x = 0.25x + 150
    # 0.15x = 150
    # x = 1000

    # Mrs. Snyder's previous monthly income was $1000
    result = 1000
    return result
