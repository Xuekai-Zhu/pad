    lauryn_earnings = 2000  # Lauryn made $2000 from selling old electronics on eBay
    aurelia_earnings = 0.7 * lauryn_earnings  # Aurelia made 70% of what Lauryn made

    # Calculate the total earnings of both friends
    total_earnings = lauryn_earnings + aurelia_earnings
    result = total_earnings
