def solution():
    # Let's assume Heracles' age as x
    # Audrey is 7 years older than Heracles, so her age is x + 7
    # In 3 years, Audrey will be (x + 7) + 3 = x + 10
    # Heracles' age in 3 years will be x + 3
    # So the equation becomes: x + 10 = 2(x + 3)
    # Solving for x, we get Heracles' current age as 4

    heracles_age = 4
    result = heracles_age
    return result
