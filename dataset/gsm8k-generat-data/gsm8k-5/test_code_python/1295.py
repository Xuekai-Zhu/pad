    # Calculate earnings from selling 10 peaches to friends
    earnings_from_friends = 10 * 2  # 10 peaches sold for $2 each

    # Calculate earnings from selling 4 peaches to relatives
    earnings_from_relatives = 4 * 1.25  # 4 peaches sold for $1.25 each

    total_earnings = earnings_from_friends + earnings_from_relatives
