def solution():
    total_pencils = 50  # Justin and Sabrina have 50 pencils combined

    # Let x be the number of pencils Sabrina has
    # Justin has 8 more than twice as many pencils as Sabrina
    # Therefore, Justin has 2x + 8 pencils
    # Their total number of pencils is 50
    # So, x + (2x + 8) = 50
    # Solving for x, we get x = 21

    sabrina_pencils = 21  # Sabrina has 21 pencils
    result = sabrina_pencils
    return result
