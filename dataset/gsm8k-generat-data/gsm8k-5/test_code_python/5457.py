def solution():
    # Let's assume the number of koi fish in the pond is x
    # According to the problem, we can write the equation:
    # 2x - 14 = 64
    # Let's solve for x:

    x = (64 + 14) / 2  # Add 14 to both sides and divide by 2
    result = x
    return result

# Alternatively, we can simplify the equation by adding 14 to both sides first:
# 2x = 78
# Then divide by 2:
# x = 39
# So there are 39 koi fish in the pond.
