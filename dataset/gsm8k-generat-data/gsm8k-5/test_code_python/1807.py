def solution():
    # Set up the equations based on the given information
    # Let x be the number of Alien Baseball cards
    # Then, Monster Club cards = 2x and Battle Gremlins cards = 3x
    # Also, Battle Gremlins cards = 48
    x = 16  # Solving for x, we get x = 16

    # Therefore, Monster Club cards = 2x = 32
    result = 32
    return result
