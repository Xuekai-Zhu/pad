def solution():
    # Let x be the number of peaches that Benjy has
    # Martine has 6 more than twice as many peaches as Benjy, so Martine has 2x + 6 peaches
    # Benjy has one-third as many peaches as Gabrielle, so Gabrielle has 3x peaches
    # Martine has 16 peaches, so 2x + 6 = 16
    # Solving for x, we get x = 5
    # Therefore, Benjy has 5 peaches and Gabrielle has 3x = 15 peaches

    gabrielle_peaches = 15
    result = gabrielle_peaches
    return result
