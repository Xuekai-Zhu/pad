def solution():
    total_apples = 80  # Ali and Sara ate a total of 80 apples

    # Let's assume Sara ate "x" apples
    # According to the problem, Ali ate 4 times more apples than Sara. So Ali ate 4x apples.
    # The total number of apples is 80, so:
    # x + 4x = 80
    # 5x = 80
    # x = 16

    sara_apples = 16  # Sara ate 16 apples
    result = sara_apples
    return result
