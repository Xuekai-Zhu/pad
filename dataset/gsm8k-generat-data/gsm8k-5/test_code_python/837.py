def solution():
    # Each dog has 4 legs, and each person has 2 legs
    # Let's assume that Mariel is one of the dog walkers, which means there are 2 people walking the dogs
    # This means that the number of legs from the dogs that Mariel is walking plus the number of legs from the other dogs equals 36
    # Let d be the number of dogs that Mariel is walking
    # Then, the total number of legs can be represented as: 4d + 2(3) = 36
    # Solving for d, we get d = 7

    dogs_walked_by_mariel = 7
    result = dogs_walked_by_mariel
    return result
