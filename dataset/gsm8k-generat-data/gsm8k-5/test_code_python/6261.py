def solution():
    # Let x be the cost of 1 pair of pants, and y be the cost of 1 shirt
    # Then we have the following system of equations:
    # 2x + 5y = 62
    # 2y = 20
    # Solving for y, we get y = 10
    # Substituting y into the first equation, we get 2x + 5(10) = 62
    # Simplifying, we get 2x + 50 = 62
    # Solving for x, we get x = 6

    # Therefore, 1 pair of pants costs $6
    result = 6
    return result
