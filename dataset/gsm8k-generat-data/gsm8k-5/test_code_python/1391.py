    # Calculate Arthur's age based on Susan's age
    arthur_age = 15 + 2  # Arthur is 2 years older than Susan

    # Calculate Tom's age based on Bob's age
    tom_age = 11 - 3  # Tom is 3 years younger than Bob

    # Calculate the total age of all four siblings
    total_age = bob_age + susan_age + arthur_age + tom_age
