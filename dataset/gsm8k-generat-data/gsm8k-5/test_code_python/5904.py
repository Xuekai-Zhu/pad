def solution():
    # Let's say Phil has x spots
    # Then Bill has (2x - 1) spots
    # And their total spots is 59
    # So we can write the equation: x + (2x - 1) = 59
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 20
    # Therefore, Phil has 20 spots and Bill has (2*20 - 1) = 39 spots

    bill_spots = 39
    result = bill_spots
    return result
