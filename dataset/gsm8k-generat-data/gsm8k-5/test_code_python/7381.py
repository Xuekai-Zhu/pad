def solution():
    # Let x be Jessica's current age
    # From the problem, we know that Jessica's mother would be x + 20 (10 years after her mother's age at death)
    # We also know that Jessica was half her mother's age when her mother died, so:
    # x = (x + 20) / 2
    # Solving for x, we get:
    jessica_age = 30  # Jessica is currently 30 years old

    return jessica_age
