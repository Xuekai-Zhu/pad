def solution():
    # Let's assume Pam's current age is x
    # Then Rena's current age is 2x

    # In 10 years, Rena will be 5 years older than Pam
    # So, Rena's age after 10 years will be (x + 10 + 5) = (x + 15)
    # And Pam's age after 10 years will be (x + 10)

    # Since Rena's age after 10 years is twice Pam's age after 10 years, we can write:
    # 2(x + 10) = (x + 15)

    # Solving the equation, we get:
    x = 5

    # Therefore, Pam's current age is 5 years
    result = x
    return result
