def solution():
    # Let's assume that the number of boys is 3x and the number of girls is 5x.
    # We also know that there are 4 more girls than boys, so we can write the equation: 5x - 3x = 4
    # Solving for x, we get x = 2.
    # Therefore, there are 3x boys = 3(2) = 6 boys and 5x girls = 5(2) = 10 girls in the classroom.
    # The total number of students is 6 + 10 = 16.
    
    result = 16
    return result
