def solution():
    # Let's call the smallest integer "x"
    # The other two integers will be "x+1" and "x+2"
    # We know that their sum is 18
    # So x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 18
    # Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 3 = 18
    # Solving for x, we get x = 5
    # Therefore, the largest integer is x+2 = 7
    result = 7
    return result
