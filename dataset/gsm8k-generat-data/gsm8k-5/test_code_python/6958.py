def solution():
    total_tickets = 150  # Alan and Marcy handed out a total of 150 tickets

    # Let's use x to represent the number of tickets that Alan handed out
    # Then the number of tickets that Marcy handed out is given by 5x - 6
    # We can set up an equation based on the fact that their total is 150:
    # x + 5x - 6 = 150
    # Solving for x:
    # 6x = 156
    # x = 26

    alan_tickets = 26
    result = alan_tickets
    return result
