def solution():
    # Let x be the number of blind students
    # Since the deaf student population is three times the size of the blind student population, we have:
    # 3x = 180
    x = 60  # Solve for x: x = 60

    # The total number of students is the sum of deaf and blind students
    total_students = 180 + 60  # 180 deaf students + 60 blind students

    result = total_students
    return result
