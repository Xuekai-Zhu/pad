def solution():
    # Let's assume there are 'x' fish in the tank
    # One third of them are blue, so (1/3)x = number of blue fish
    # Half of the blue fish have spots, so (1/2)(1/3)x = number of blue, spotted fish
    # We know there are 10 blue, spotted fish, so (1/2)(1/3)x = 10
    # Solving for 'x', we get:
    x = 60  # There are 60 fish in the tank

    result = x
    return result
