def solution():
    distance = 30  # total distance to run is 30 miles
    jesse_distance = (2/3) * 3 + 10  # Jesse runs (2/3) mile for 3 days, then 10 miles on day 4
    mia_distance = 3 * 4  # Mia runs 3 miles for 4 days

    # Calculate the remaining distance to be covered by both of them
    remaining_distance = distance - jesse_distance - mia_distance

    # Calculate the required average speed for the remaining 3 days
    required_speed = remaining_distance / 3

    # Calculate the average of their averages for the first 4 days
    average_speed = (jesse_distance/4 + mia_distance/4)/2

    # Calculate the final average speed for the entire week
    final_average_speed = (jesse_distance + mia_distance + remaining_distance) / 7

    # Calculate the average of the required speed and final average speed
    average_of_averages = (required_speed + final_average_speed) / 2

    result = average_of_averages
    return result
