def solution():
    # If Rebecca received 40 books, then the total number of books that Mara and Rebecca received is 3+1=4 times that number
    total_books_received = 4 * 40  # Mara and Rebecca received 4 * 40 = 160 books

    # Since Roselyn remained with 60 books, she must have had 160 + 60 = 220 books before giving some away
    result = 220
