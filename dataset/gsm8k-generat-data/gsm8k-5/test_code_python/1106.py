def solution():
    # Let x be the age of the older friend
    # Then the age of the younger friend is x - 2
    # The sum of their ages is 74: x + (x-2) = 74
    # This simplifies to 2x - 2 = 74, or 2x = 76, or x = 38
    
    age_of_older_friend = 38  # x is 38
    
    result = age_of_older_friend
