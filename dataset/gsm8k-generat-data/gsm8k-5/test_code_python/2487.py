def solution():
    # Calculate the cost of flour
    flour_cost = 3 * 3  # 3 boxes of flour that cost $3 each

    # Calculate the cost of eggs
    eggs_cost = 3 * 10  # 3 trays of eggs that cost $10 each

    # Calculate the cost of milk
    milk_cost = 7 * 5  # 7 liters of milk that cost $5 each

    # Calculate the cost of baking soda
    baking_soda_cost = 2 * 3  # 2 boxes of baking soda that cost $3 each

    # Calculate the total cost
    total_cost = flour_cost + eggs_cost + milk_cost + baking_soda_cost
    result = total_cost
