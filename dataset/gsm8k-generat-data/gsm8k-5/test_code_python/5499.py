def solution():
    # Calculate the distance Grayson travels at 25 mph
    distance_25 = 25 * 1

    # Calculate the distance Grayson travels at 20 mph
    distance_20 = 20 * 0.5

    # Calculate the total distance Grayson travels
    total_distance = distance_25 + distance_20

    # Calculate the distance Rudy rows
    distance_rudy = 10 * 3

    # Calculate the difference in distance between Grayson and Rudy
    difference = total_distance - distance_rudy
    result = difference
