def solution():
    total_rain = 22  # Total amount of rain in the first two hours is 22 inches

    # Let x be the amount of rain in the first hour
    # It rains 7 inches more than twice the amount it rained the first hour in the second hour
    # Therefore, the amount of rain in the second hour is 2x + 7
    # The total amount of rain in the first two hours is 22 inches
    # Therefore, x + 2x + 7 = 22
    # Simplifying and solving for x, we get x = 5

    amount_rain_first_hour = 5  # It rained 5 inches in the first hour
    result = amount_rain_first_hour
    return result
