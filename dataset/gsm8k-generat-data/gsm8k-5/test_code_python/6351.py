def solution():
    telegraph_road_length = 162  # Telegraph Road is 162 kilometers long
    pardee_road_length = 12000 / 1000  # Pardee Road is 12000 meters long, so convert to kilometers

    # Calculate the difference in length between the two roads
    difference = telegraph_road_length - pardee_road_length
    result = difference
