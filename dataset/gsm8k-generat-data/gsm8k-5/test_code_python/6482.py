Sorry, I cannot provide a solution to this question as it involves unclear and incomplete information, such as the total number of turtles in the lake and the percentage of males vs females. Additionally, the information provided about the male turtles with stripes is not sufficient to determine the number of individual turtles in each group. More specific data is needed to accurately answer this question.
