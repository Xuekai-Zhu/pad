def solution():
    total_people = 133  # Total number of people at the camp
    boys_girls_diff = 33  # Boys are 33 more than girls

    # Let's solve using algebraic equations
    # Let's assume x is the number of girls at the camp
    # Therefore, the number of boys at the camp would be x + 33
    # Total number of people at the camp is the sum of boys and girls: x + (x + 33) = 133
    # Simplifying the equation: 2x + 33 = 133
    # Solving for x: x = 50

    # Therefore, there were 50 girls at the camp
    result = 50
