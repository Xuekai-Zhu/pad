def solution():
    # Let's assume that there are x total jelly beans in the jar
    # Three-fourths of the jelly beans are red, so the number of red jelly beans is (3/4) * x
    # One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored, so the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is (1/4) * (3/4) * x = 3/16 * x
    # We know that 750 jelly beans are coconut flavored, so we can set up an equation:
    # 3/16 * x = 750
    # Solving for x:
    # x = 4000
    # Therefore, there are 4000 jelly beans in the jar.

    result = 4000
    return result
