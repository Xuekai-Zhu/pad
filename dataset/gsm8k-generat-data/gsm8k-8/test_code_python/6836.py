    # According to the given information, Marius scored 3 points more than Darius
    marius_score = 10 + 3

    # And Darius scored 5 points less than Matt
    matt_score = 10 + 5

    # Therefore, the total score of all three friends would be the sum of their individual scores
    total_score = 10 + marius_score + matt_score
