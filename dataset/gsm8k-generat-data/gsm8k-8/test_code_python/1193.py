    # Calculate the total cost of the fruit, as each orange costs $4.50
    fruit_cost = 3 * 4.5

    # Calculate the total cost of the juices, as each juice costs $0.50
    juice_cost = 7 * 0.5

    # Calculate the total cost of the jars of honey, as each jar costs $5
    honey_cost = 3 * 5

    # Calculate the total cost of the plants, as 2 plants cost $18
    plant_cost = 2 * 9

    # Calculate the total cost of Joe's purchases
    total_cost = fruit_cost + juice_cost + honey_cost + plant_cost
    result = total_cost
