def solution():
    # Define the variables
    total_messages = 93
    x = number of phone messages
    y = number of emails

    # Set up the equations
    y = 9x - 7
    x + y = total_messages

    # Substitute the first equation into the second
    x + (9x - 7) = total_messages

    # Simplify and solve for x
    10x - 7 = total_messages
    x = (total_messages + 7) / 10

    # Calculate the number of emails
    y = 9x - 7

    result = y
    return result
