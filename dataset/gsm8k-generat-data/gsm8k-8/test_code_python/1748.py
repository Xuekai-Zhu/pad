def solution():
    # Let's call the number of trucks "t"
    # Jeff has twice as many cars as trucks, so he has 2t cars
    # The total number of vehicles is 60, so t + 2t = 60
    # Combining like terms gives us 3t = 60
    # Dividing both sides by 3 gives us t = 20
    # So Jeff has 20 trucks
    result = 20
    return result
