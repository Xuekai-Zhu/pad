def solution():
    # Define Lottie's earnings as a variable
    L = 0

    # Jerusha earned 4 times as much as Lottie, so Jerusha's earnings are 4L
    # Together, they earned $85, so L + 4L = $85
    # Simplifying the equation, 5L = $85, so L = $17
    L = 17
    jerusha_earnings = 4 * L
    result = jerusha_earnings
    return result
