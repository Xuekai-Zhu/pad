def solution():
    # Calculate the total number of fruit before half of it fell out
    total_fruit = 6 + 4 + 2 + x # Let x be the number of plums Tanya bought

    # Calculate the number of fruit after half fell out
    remaining_fruit = total_fruit / 2

    # Set up an equation to solve for x (number of plums)
    remaining_fruit = 9
    total_fruit = 6 + 4 + 2 + x
    x = (remaining_fruit * 2) - (6 + 4 + 2)
    result = x
    return result
