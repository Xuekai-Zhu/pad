def solution():
    # Define the number of Doberman puppies
    doberman_puppies = 20

    # Define the equation based on the given information
    equation = 3 * doberman_puppies - 5 + (doberman_puppies - schnauzers) == 90

    # Rearrange the equation to solve for the number of schnauzers
    schnauzers = 4 * doberman_puppies - 95

    result = schnauzers
    return result
