def solution():
    # Calculate the total amount of wool produced
    total_wool = 200 * 10

    # Calculate the total revenue from selling the wool
    total_revenue = total_wool * 20

    # Calculate the total cost of paying the shearer
    total_cost = 2000

    # Calculate the profit made from the wool production
    profit = total_revenue - total_cost
    result = profit
