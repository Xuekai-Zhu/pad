    # Calculate the money Stormi earns from washing cars

    # Calculate the money Stormi earns from mowing lawns
    lawn_money = 2 * 13

    # Calculate the total money Stormi earns
    total_money = car_money + lawn_money

    # Calculate the difference between the total money and the bicycle cost
    difference = 80 - total_money
