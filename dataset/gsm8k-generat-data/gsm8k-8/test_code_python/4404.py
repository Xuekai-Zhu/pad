    # Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 woodburnings at $15 each
    total_revenue = 20 * 15

    # Calculate the total cost of the wood
    wood_cost = 100

    # Calculate the total profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue
    total_profit = total_revenue - wood_cost

    result = total_profit
