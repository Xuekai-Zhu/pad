def solution():
    total_pencils = 50
    # Let's assume that Sabrina has x pencils
    # Justin has 8 more than twice Sabrina's pencils, which means Justin has 2x+8 pencils
    # According to the problem, the total number of pencils Justin and Sabrina have is 50
    # Therefore, we can create an equation: x + (2x+8) = 50
    # Simplifying the equation, we get 3x+8 = 50
    # Solving for x, we get x = 14

    sabrina_pencils = 14
    result = sabrina_pencils
    return result
