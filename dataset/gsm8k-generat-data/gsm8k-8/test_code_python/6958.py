def solution():
    # Let x be the number of tickets Alan handed out
    # Marcy handed out 5x - 6 tickets
    # Their total number of tickets is 150
    # Therefore, x + (5x - 6) = 150
    # Simplifying this equation, we get 6x = 156
    # So, x = 26
    
    alan_tickets = 26
    result = alan_tickets
    return result
