def solution():
    # Define the ratio of packages to meals
    packages_to_meals_ratio = 8

    # Calculate the total number of packages and meals
    total = 27

    # Use algebra to solve for the number of meals
    # Let x be the number of meals
    # Then 8x is the number of packages
    # The total number of meals and packages is x + 8x = 9x
    # Solving for x, we get x = total / 9
    meals = total / 9
    result = meals
