def solution():
    # Let x be the amount of money Lucy had at the beginning
    # Lucy lost one-third of her money, so she has (2/3)x left
    # Lucy spent one-fourth of the remainder, so she has (3/4)(2/3)x = (1/2)x left
    # (1/2)x = 15, so x = 30
    # Therefore, Lucy had $30 at the beginning
    result = 30
