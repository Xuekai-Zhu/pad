def solution():
    # Calculate the total number of apples and watermelons bought
    # since they are priced at the same rate
    total_apples_and_watermelons = 36/2 = 18

    # Calculate the total cost of oranges
    total_oranges_cost = 0.5 * 36 = 18

    # Calculate the total cost of apples and watermelons
    total_apples_and_watermelons_cost = 18*x, where x is the price of 1 apple

    # Calculate the total bill
    total_bill = total_oranges_cost + total_apples_and_watermelons_cost = 66

    # Calculate the price of 1 apple
    x = (66 - 18) / 18 = 3

    result = x
    return result
