def solution():
    # Calculate the cost of the five textbooks bought on sale
    sale_cost = 5 * 10

    # Calculate the total cost of the two textbooks ordered online
    online_cost = 40

    # Calculate the cost of three textbooks bought directly from the bookstore
    bookstore_cost = 3 * 40

    # Calculate the total cost of all the textbooks
    total_cost = sale_cost + online_cost + bookstore_cost
