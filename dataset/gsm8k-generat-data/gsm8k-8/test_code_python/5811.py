def solution():
    # Calculate the amount earned from mowing in September
    mowing_earnings = 4 * 25

    # Calculate the amount earned from pulling weeds in September
    weed_earnings = 8 * 3

    # Calculate the total earnings in September
    september_earnings = mowing_earnings + weed_earnings

    # Calculate the total earnings in October
    october_earnings = (4 * 25) + (8 * 3)

    # Calculate the total earnings in September and October
    total_earnings = september_earnings + october_earnings
    result = total_earnings
    return result
