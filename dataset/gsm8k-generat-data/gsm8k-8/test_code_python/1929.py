def solution():
    # Set up a proportion to find the number of beanie babies Sydney has
    # Let x be the number of beanie babies Sydney has
    # Then 15x = 300
    # Solving for x gives x = 20
    sydney_beanies = 20

    # Calculate the total number of beanie babies
    total_beanies = sydney_beanies + 300
