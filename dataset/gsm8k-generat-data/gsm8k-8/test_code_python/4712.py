    # Calculate the time it takes to walk 3 miles at a speed of 3 miles per hour
    walk_time = 3 / 3

    # Calculate the time it takes to run 10 miles at a speed of 5 miles per hour
    run_time = 10 / 5

    # Calculate the total time spent exercising in one day
    total_time = walk_time + run_time

    # Calculate the total time spent exercising in one week
    total_time_per_week = total_time * 7

    result = total_time_per_week
