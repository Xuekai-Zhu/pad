def solution():
    # Calculate the total cost of the basketball cards
    basketball_cost = 2 * 3

    # Calculate the total cost of the baseball cards
    baseball_cost = 5 * 4

    # Calculate the total cost of all the cards
    total_cost = basketball_cost + baseball_cost

    # Calculate the amount of change Olivia received
    change = 50 - total_cost
    result = change
    return result
