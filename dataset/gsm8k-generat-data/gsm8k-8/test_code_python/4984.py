def solution():
    # Let x be Bill's current years of experience
    # Let y be Joan's current years of experience

    # 5 years ago: y-5 = 3(x-5)
    # Now: y = 2x

    # Substitute y in the first equation and solve for x
    # 2x - 5 = 3(x - 5)
    # 2x - 5 = 3x - 15
    # x = 10

    # Bill currently has 10 years of experience
    result = 10
    return result
