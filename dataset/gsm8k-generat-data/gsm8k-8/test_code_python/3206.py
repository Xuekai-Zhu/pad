def solution():
    # Define the number of days in a week
    days_in_week = 7

    # Define the number of computers produced per week
    computers_per_week = 1500 * days_in_week

    # Calculate the total revenue from selling the computers
    total_revenue = computers_per_week * 150

    result = total_revenue
