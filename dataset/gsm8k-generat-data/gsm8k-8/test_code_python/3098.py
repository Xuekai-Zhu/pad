def solution():
    # Since the ages are consecutive integers, we can represent them as x, x+1, and x+2
    # The sum of their ages is 96, so x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 96
    # Simplifying, we get 3x + 3 = 96
    # Solving for x, we get x = 31

    youngest_brother_age = 31
    result = youngest_brother_age
