def solution():
    # Let's assume Pam's age now is p and Rena's is r
    # We know that p = 0.5r
    # We also know that in 10 years, r+5 = p+10
    # Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
    # r+5 = 0.5r + 10
    # Solving for r, we get:
    # r = 10
    # Now we can find Pam's age:
    # p = 0.5r = 0.5 * 10 = 5
    result = 5
    return result
