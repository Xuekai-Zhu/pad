def solution():
    # Define the ratio of cards divided between Ellis and Orion
    ellis_to_orion_ratio = 11/9

    # Calculate the total number of cards divided
    total_cards = 500

    # Calculate the sum of the ratios in order to find the value of one ratio
    total_ratio = 11 + 9

    # Calculate the value of one ratio
    one_ratio = total_cards / total_ratio

    # Calculate the number of cards Ellis received
    ellis_cards = 11 * one_ratio

    # Calculate the number of cards Orion received
    orion_cards = 9 * one_ratio

    # Calculate the difference between the number of cards Ellis and Orion received
    difference = ellis_cards - orion_cards
    result = difference
