def solution():
    # Calculate the cost of buying 500 newspapers at 75% discount
    cost = 500 * 2 * 0.25

    # Calculate the revenue from selling 80% of the newspapers at $2 each
    revenue = 400 * 2

    # Calculate the profit by subtracting the cost from the revenue
    profit = revenue - cost
    result = profit
    return result
