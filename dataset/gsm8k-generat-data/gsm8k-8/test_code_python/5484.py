def solution():
    # Let's assume the number of red marbles as x
    # Then the number of blue marbles would be x + 24
    
    # According to the second condition, the number of blue marbles is 5 times the number of red marbles
    # Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
    # x + 24 = 5x
    
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 6
    
    # Therefore, Brett has 6 red marbles
    result = x
    return result
