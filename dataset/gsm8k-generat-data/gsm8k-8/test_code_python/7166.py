def solution():
    # Let x be the number of degrees Jolly has
    # Summer has x + 5 more degrees than Jolly
    # Summer has a total of 150 degrees
    # Therefore, x + (x + 5) = 150
    # Simplifying the equation gives 2x + 5 = 150
    # Solving for x gives x = 72.5

    jolly_degrees = 72.5
    summer_degrees = jolly_degrees + 5
    combined_degrees = jolly_degrees + summer_degrees
    result = combined_degrees
    return result
