def solution():
    # Calculate the total cost of printing the essay
    essay_cost = 10 * 25 * 7

    # Calculate the cost of buying the pens
    pen_cost = 1.5 * 7

    # Calculate the total cost of the purchase
    total_cost = essay_cost + pen_cost

    # Calculate the amount paid by Jenny
    paid = 2 * 20

    # Calculate the change
    change = paid - total_cost
    result = change
