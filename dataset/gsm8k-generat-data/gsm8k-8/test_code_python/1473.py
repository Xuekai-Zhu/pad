def solution():
    # Define the total number of books sold across all three months
    total_books = 15 + 16 + x 

    # Calculate the average number of books sold per month
    avg_books_per_month = total_books / 3

    # Set the equation for the average and solve for x (number of books sold in March)
    avg_books_per_month = 16
    total_books = 15 + 16 + x
    16 = total_books / 3
    48 = total_books
    x = 48 - 15 - 16
    result = x
    return result
