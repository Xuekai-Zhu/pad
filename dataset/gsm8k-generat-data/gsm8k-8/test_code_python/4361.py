def solution():
    # Each tripodasaurus has 3 legs and 1 head
    # So the total number of legs is 3 times the number of tripodasauruses
    # And the total number of heads is the same as the number of tripodasauruses
    # Therefore, 3x + x = 20, where x is the number of tripodasauruses
    # Simplifying the equation, we get:
    # 4x = 20
    # x = 5
    # So there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock
    result = 5
    return result
