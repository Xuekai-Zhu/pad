def solution():
    # Calculate the total time taken for the three laps
    total_time = 70 + (2 * 85)

    # Convert total time to seconds
    total_time_in_seconds = total_time

    # Calculate the total distance covered
    total_distance = 3 * 400

    # Calculate the average speed
    average_speed = total_distance / total_time_in_seconds

    # Convert average speed to meters per second (m/s)
    average_speed_mps = average_speed

    result = average_speed_mps
