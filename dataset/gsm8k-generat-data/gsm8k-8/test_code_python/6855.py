    # Define the ratio of time for dyeing to bleaching
    dyeing_to_bleaching_ratio = 2

    # Calculate the total time for dyeing and bleaching
    total_time = 9

    # Calculate the sum of the ratios in order to find the value of one ratio
    total_ratio = 1 + dyeing_to_bleaching_ratio

    # Calculate the value of one ratio
    one_ratio = total_time / total_ratio

    # Calculate the time for bleaching
    bleaching_time = one_ratio
