def solution():
    # Calculate the number of iris bulbs planted
    iris_bulbs = 20/2

    # Calculate the number of crocus bulbs planted
    crocus_bulbs = 30*3

    # Calculate the total number of bulbs planted
    total_bulbs = 20 + iris_bulbs + 30 + crocus_bulbs

    # Calculate Jane's earnings
    earnings = total_bulbs * 0.5
    result = earnings
