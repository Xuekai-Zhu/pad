def solution():
    # Define the ratio of Elsa's coins to Amalie's coins
    elsa_to_amalie_ratio = 10/45

    # Calculate the total number of coins they have
    total_coins = 440

    # Calculate the sum of the ratios in order to find the value of one ratio
    total_ratio = 10 + 45

    # Calculate the value of one ratio
    one_ratio = total_coins / total_ratio

    # Calculate Amalie's current number of coins
    amalie_coins = 45 * one_ratio

    # Calculate the amount Amalie spends on toys
    toy_spending = 0.75 * amalie_coins

    # Calculate the amount Amalie will remain with
    remaining_coins = amalie_coins - toy_spending
    result = remaining_coins
    return result
