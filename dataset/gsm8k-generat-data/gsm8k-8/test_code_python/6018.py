def solution():
    # Define the number of brownies eaten on Monday
    monday_brownies = 5

    # Define the number of brownies eaten on Tuesday (twice as many as Monday)
    tuesday_brownies = monday_brownies * 2

    # Calculate the total number of brownies eaten
    total_brownies_eaten = monday_brownies + tuesday_brownies

    # Calculate the total number of brownies Katy made
    total_brownies_made = total_brownies_eaten

    result = total_brownies_made
