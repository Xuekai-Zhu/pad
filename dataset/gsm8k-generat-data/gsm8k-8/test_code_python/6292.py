def solution():
    # Let x be Allen's present age
    # Then his mother's age is x + 25

    # In 3 years, their ages will be x + 3 and x + 28
    # The sum of their ages in 3 years will be 41
    # So we have the equation x + 3 + (x + 25 + 3) = 41

    # Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 31 = 41
    # Therefore, 2x = 10 and x = 5

    # Allen's present age is 5, and his mother's age is 30
    result = 30
    return result
