def solution():
    # Define the ratio of Ian's chips to Lyle's chips
    ian_to_lyle_ratio = 4/6

    # Calculate the total number of chips
    total_chips = 100

    # Calculate the sum of the ratios in order to find the value of one ratio
    total_ratio = 4 + 6

    # Calculate the value of one ratio
    one_ratio = total_chips / total_ratio

    # Calculate Lyle's number of chips
    lyle_chips = 6 * one_ratio

    # Calculate the percentage of chips that Lyle has
    lyle_percentage = (lyle_chips / total_chips) * 100
    result = lyle_percentage
