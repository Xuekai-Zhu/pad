def solution():
    """If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena is, and in 10 years Rena will be 5 years older than her, how old is Pam now?"""
    # Let's use algebra to solve this problem
    # Let's say Pam's current age is p and Rena's current age is r
    # We know that: p = 2r (Pam is currently twice as young as Rena)
    # We also know that: r + 10 = p + 15 (In 10 years, Rena will be 5 years older than Pam)

    # Let's rewrite the second equation as: r - p = 5
    # Now we have two equations with two variables, so we can solve for r and p
    # Multiplying the first equation by -1, we get: -p = -2r
    # Adding this to the second equation, we get: r - p + (-2r) = 5
    # Simplifying, we get: -r - p = 5
    # Multiplying by -1 again, we get: r + p = -5

    # Now we have a system of two linear equations:
    # p = 2r
    # r + p = -5

    # Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get:
    # r + 2r = -5
    # Solving for r, we get: r = -5/3

    # This doesn't make sense as a solution, since we can't have negative ages. 
    # Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.

    # We cannot solve this problem with the given information.

    return "Cannot be solved with the given information."
