def solution():
    """Beth went shopping. She bought 15 more cans of peas than twice the number of cans of corn that she bought. If she bought 35 cans of peas, how many cans of corn did she buy?"""
    # Let's represent the number of cans of corn Beth bought as x
    # Then, the number of cans of peas she bought can be represented as 2x + 15

    # We know that she bought 35 cans of peas, so we can set up the following equation:
    35 = 2x + 15

    # Solving for x:
    2x = 20
    x = 10

    # Beth bought 10 cans of corn
    result = 10
    return result
