def solution():
    """Markese earned 5 fewer dollars than Evan. Together they earned $37. How many dollars did Markese earn? Use E to represent how many dollars Evan earned."""
    # Let E be the amount Evan earned
    # Then Markese earned E - 5
    # Together they earned E + (E-5) = 2E - 5 = 37
    # Solving for E, we get E = 21
    # Markese earned E - 5 = 16

    # Calculate Markese's earnings
    markese_earnings = 16

    # Display Markese's earnings
    result = markese_earnings
