def solution():
    """Alexis has four times as many mangoes as Dilan and Ashley combined. If Alexis has 60 mangoes, how many mangoes does all of them have combined?"""
    # Let x be the number of mangoes Dilan and Ashley have combined
    # Then Alexis has 4x mangoes
    # We know that 4x = 60, so x = 15

    # Therefore, Dilan and Ashley have a total of 15 mangoes
    # And Alexis has 4 * 15 = 60 mangoes

    # The total number of mangoes all of them have combined is 15 + 60 = 75
    result = 75
    return result
