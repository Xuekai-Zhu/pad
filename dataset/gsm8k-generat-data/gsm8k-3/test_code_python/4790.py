def solution():
    """In five years, Rehana will be three times as old as Phoebe. If Rehana is currently 25 years old, and Jacob, Rehana's brother, is 3/5 of Phoebe's current age, how old is Jacob now?"""
    # Let's assume Phoebe's current age is x
    # Then, Rehana's age in 5 years will be 25 + 5 = 30, and her current age is 25
    # According to the problem, 30 = 3(x + 5)
    # Simplifying this equation, we get x = 5
    # Therefore, Phoebe's current age is 5, and Jacob's current age is (3/5)*5 = 3

    # Display Jacob's current age
    result = 3
