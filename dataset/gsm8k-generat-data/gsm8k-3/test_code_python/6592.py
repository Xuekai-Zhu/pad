def solution():
    """The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?"""
    # Let x be the size of Martha's bedroom
    # Then Jenny's bedroom is x + 60

    # The total square footage is 300
    # So we have x + x + 60 = 300
    # Simplifying, we get 2x = 240
    # Solving for x, we get x = 120

    # Therefore, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet

    result = 120
