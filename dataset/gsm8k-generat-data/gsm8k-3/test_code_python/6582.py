def solution():
    """A new edition Geometry book has 450 pages which are 230 pages less than twice as many pages as the old edition. How many pages did the old edition Geometry book have?"""
    # Let x be the number of pages in the old edition book
    # The new edition has 450 pages, which is 230 less than twice the number of pages in the old edition
    # Therefore, we have the equation: 450 = 2x - 230
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = (450 + 230) / 2

    # Display the number of pages in the old edition book
    result = x
    return result
