def solution():
    """Maiya has two sisters. The first sister is twice as old as Maiya. The first sister is 1 year younger than Maiya. Their average age is 5. How old is Maiya?"""
    # Let's assume Maiya's age to be x
    # The first sister is twice as old as Maiya
    # Therefore, the first sister's age is 2x
    # The first sister is one year younger than Maiya
    # Therefore, the first sister's age is x-1

    # The average age of the three sisters is 5
    # Therefore, (x + 2x + x-1) / 3 = 5
    # Simplifying the equation, we get, 4x / 3 = 6
    # Solving for x, we get, x = 4.5

    # Therefore, Maiya is 4.5 years old
    result = 4.5
