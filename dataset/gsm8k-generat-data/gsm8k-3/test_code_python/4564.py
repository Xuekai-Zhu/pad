def solution():
    """Fiona and Casey share the hoodies they own. Between the two of them, they own eight hoodies. Casey owns two more than Fiona. How many hoodies does Fiona own?"""
    # Set up algebraic equation
    # Let x be the number of hoodies Fiona owns
    # Then Casey owns x + 2 hoodies
    # The sum of their hoodies is 8
    # So x + (x + 2) = 8
    # Simplifying: 2x + 2 = 8
    # Solving for x: x = 3

    # Fiona owns 3 hoodies
    result = 3
    return result
