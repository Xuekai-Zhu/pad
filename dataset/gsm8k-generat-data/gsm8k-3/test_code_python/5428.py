def solution():
    """Andy walks 50 meters from his house to school. After school, he comes back to the house and goes to the market. If he walks 140 meters in total, how many meters is the distance between the house and the market?"""
    # Let x be the distance between the house and the market
    # Total distance walked is 50 meters to school, 50 meters back home, and x meters to market and back home
    # Therefore, 50 + 50 + 2x = 140
    # 2x = 40
    # x = 20

    # The distance between the house and the market is 20 meters
    result = 20
