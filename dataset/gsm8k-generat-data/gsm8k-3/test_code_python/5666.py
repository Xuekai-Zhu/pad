def solution():
    """Steve is holding nickels and dimes in his hand. He has 4 more dimes than nickels. He has a total of 70 cents in his hand. How many nickels is he holding?"""
    # Let x be the number of nickels Steve is holding
    # Then, he has x+4 dimes
    # The total value of the coins is 5x + 10(x+4) = 70 cents
    # Simplifying, we get 15x + 40 = 70
    # Solving for x, we get x = 2

    # So Steve is holding 2 nickels
    result = 2
