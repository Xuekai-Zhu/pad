def solution():
    """The Chrysler Building has 11 more floors than the Leeward Center. Together they have a total of 35 floors. How many floors does the Chrysler Building have?"""
    # Let x be the number of floors in the Leeward Center
    # Then the number of floors in the Chrysler Building is x + 11
    # Together they have a total of 35 floors, so x + (x + 11) = 35
    # Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 11 = 35
    # Solving for x, we get x = 12
    # Therefore, the number of floors in the Chrysler Building is x + 11 = 23
    
    chrysler_floors = 23
    result = chrysler_floors
