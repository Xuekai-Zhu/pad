    """Every year, Tabitha adds a new color to her hair.  She started this tradition when she was 15 years old, which was the year she added her second hair color.  In three years, Tabitha will have 8 different colors in the hair.  Currently, how old is Tabitha?"""
    # Let x be the number of years since Tabitha started adding colors
    # Then Tabitha's current age is 15 + x
    # After x years, Tabitha will have added x + 2 colors
    # So x + 2 = 8 - 3 (since in three years, Tabitha will have 8 colors)
    # Solving for x, we get x = 3
    # Therefore, Tabitha is currently 15 + 3 = 18 years old

    # Display Tabitha's age
    result = 18
