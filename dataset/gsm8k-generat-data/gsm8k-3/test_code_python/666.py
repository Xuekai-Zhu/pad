def solution():
    """Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams. Together, they have $150. How much money, in dollars, does Jackson have?"""
    # Let's assume Williams has x dollars
    # Then Jackson has 5 times more money than Williams, which is 5x dollars

    # Together, they have $150, so:
    # x + 5x = $150
    # 6x = $150
    # x = $25

    # Therefore, Williams has $25 and Jackson has 5 times more, which is $125
    result = 125
