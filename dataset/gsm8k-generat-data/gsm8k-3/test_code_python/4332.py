def solution():
    """Bill and Jean are both cleaning out their garages. Bill makes a certain number of trips to the dump and Jean makes that many trips plus 6. If they make 40 trips total, how many trips does Jean make?"""
    # Let x be the number of trips Bill makes
    # Then Jean makes x + 6 trips
    # The total number of trips is 40
    # So we have the equation x + (x + 6) = 40
    # Simplifying, we get 2x + 6 = 40
    # Substracting 6 from both sides, we get 2x = 34
    # Dividing by 2, we get x = 17
    # Therefore, Jean makes x + 6 = 23 trips

    # Display the number of trips Jean makes
    result = 23
    return result
