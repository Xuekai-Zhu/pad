In the next five weeks, she collects ten times as many books as she did in the first week. How many books did she collect in the first week if she has 99 books now?"""
    # Let x be the number of books Tracy collected in the first week
    # Then, Tracy collected 10x books in the next five weeks
    # Therefore, the total number of books Tracy collected is x + 10x = 11x
    # We know that the total number of books Tracy has now is 99
    # Therefore, 11x = 99
    # Solving for x, we get x = 9

    # So, Tracy collected 9 books in the first week
