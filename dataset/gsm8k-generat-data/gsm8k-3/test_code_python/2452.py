def solution():
    """Ten more than twice the number of birds on the fence is 50. How many birds are on the fence?"""
    # Let x be the number of birds on the fence
    # According to the problem, 10 more than twice x is 50
    # Therefore: 2x + 10 = 50
    # Solving for x:
    x = (50 - 10) / 2

    # Display the number of birds on the fence
    result = x
    return result
