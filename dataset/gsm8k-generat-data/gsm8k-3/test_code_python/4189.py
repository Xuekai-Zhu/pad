def solution():
    """In eight years, Mr. Bernard will be 3 times as old as Luke is now. If Luke is 20, what is 10 years less than their average age?"""
    # Let x be Mr. Bernard's current age
    # In 8 years, Mr. Bernard will be x + 8 years old
    # Luke is currently 20 years old, so in 8 years he will be 28 years old
    # According to the problem, we have the equation x + 8 = 3(20), which simplifies to x = 44
    # Therefore, Mr. Bernard is currently 44 years old

    # The sum of their ages is 44 + 20 = 64
    # Their average age is 64 / 2 = 32
    # 10 years less than their average age is 32 - 10 = 22

    # Display the answer
    result = 22
    return result
