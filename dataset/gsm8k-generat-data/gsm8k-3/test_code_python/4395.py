def solution():
    """Xavier is twice as old as Yasmin is. Xavier will be 30 years old in six years. What is the total of their ages now?"""
    # Let's first define Yasmin's age as y
    # Xavier is twice as old as Yasmin, so his age is 2y

    # Xavier will be 30 years old in six years, so he's currently 30 - 6 = 24 years old
    # We can use this information to solve for y:
    # 2y = 24 => y = 12

    # Yasmin is currently 12 years old
    # Xavier is 2y = 24 years old

    # The total of their ages now is:
    total_age = 12 + 24

    # Display the total age
    result = total_age
    return result
