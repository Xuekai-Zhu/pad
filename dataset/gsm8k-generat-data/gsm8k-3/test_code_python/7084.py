def solution():
    """Sally is selling boxes of crackers for her scout troop's fund-raiser. If she sells 50% more on Sunday than she sold on Saturday, then she'll have sold a total of 150 boxes on the two days. How many boxes did she sell on Saturday?"""
    # Let x be the number of boxes Sally sold on Saturday
    # Then the number of boxes she sold on Sunday is 1.5x (50% more than Saturday)

    # Total number of boxes sold is 150
    # Therefore, x + 1.5x = 150
    # Simplifying, 2.5x = 150
    # Solving for x, x = 60

    # Sally sold 60 boxes on Saturday
    result = 60
    return result
