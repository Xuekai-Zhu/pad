We can use the formula for calculating an average:

total score / number of quizzes = average score

Let's represent Lizette's score on her first two quizzes as "x". We know that her average score is 94, so:

(x + x + 92) / 3 = 94

Simplifying and solving for "x", we get:

2x + 92 = 282
2x = 190
x = 95

Therefore, Lizette's average score on her first two quizzes is 95.
