def solution():
    """The tripodasaurus has three legs. In a flock of tripodasauruses, there is a total of 20 heads and legs. How many tripodasauruses are in the flock?"""
    # Let x be the number of tripodasauruses in the flock
    # Each tripodasaurus has 3 legs and 1 head
    # Therefore, the total number of legs in the flock is 3x and the total number of heads is x
    # According to the problem, the total number of heads and legs is 20
    # Therefore, we can write the equation: 3x + x = 20
    # Simplifying, we get: 4x = 20
    # Solving for x, we get: x = 5

    # Hence, there are 5 tripodasauruses in the flock
    result = 5
