def solution():
    """Yuan is 7 years older than his brother David and twice his age. How old is David?"""
    # Let David's age be x
    # Then Yuan's age is x + 7 and also 2x
    # Equating the two expressions for Yuan's age, we get 2x = x + 7
    # Solving for x, we get x = 7
    # Therefore, David is 7 years old
