def solution():
    """Lisa has 18 more dresses than Ana. If the number of their dresses combined is 48, how many dresses does Ana have?"""
    # Let x be the number of dresses Ana has
    # Then Lisa has x + 18 dresses
    # The total number of dresses is 48
    # x + (x + 18) = 48
    # Simplifying the equation, we get:
    # 2x + 18 = 48
    # 2x = 30
    # x = 15

    # Therefore, Ana has 15 dresses
    result = 15
