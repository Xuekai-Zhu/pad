def solution():
    """Audrey is 7 years older than Heracles. In 3 years, Audrey will be twice as old as Heracles is now. How old is Heracles now?"""
    # Let's assume the current age of Heracles is x
    # Then Audrey's age is x + 7
    # In three years, Audrey will be x + 7 + 3 = x + 10 years old
    # Heracles will be x + 3 years old
    # According to the problem, Audrey will be twice as old as Heracles is now, so x + 10 = 2(x + 3)
    # Solving for x, we get x = 7
    # Therefore, Heracles is currently 7 years old
