def solution():
    """At the museum, Bethany saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits. If she saw 80 paintings total, how many portraits did she see?"""
    # Let's denote portraits with p and still lifes with s
    # We know that s = 4p (she saw 4 times more still lifes than portraits)
    # We also know that p + s = 80 (she saw 80 paintings total)
    # We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get:
    # p + 4p = 80
    # 5p = 80
    # p = 16
    # Therefore, Bethany saw 16 portraits.

    portraits = 16
    result = portraits
