def solution():
    """Marcus has three times as many cheese crackers as Mona.  Nicholas has 6 more crackers than Mona.  If Marcus has 27 crackers, how many crackers does Nicholas have?"""
    # Let's assume Mona has x cheese crackers
    # Marcus has 3x cheese crackers
    # Nicholas has x + 6 cheese crackers

    # We know Marcus has 27 crackers, so we can solve for x
    # 3x = 27
    # x = 9

    # Now we can solve for Nicholas' number of crackers
    # Nicholas has x + 6 crackers
    # Nicholas has 9 + 6 crackers
    # Nicholas has 15 crackers

    # Display Nicholas' number of crackers
    result = 15
