def solution():
    """Daytona Beach has 26 shark sightings a year. Daytona Beach has 5 more than triple the number of shark sightings as Cape May. How many shark sightings are there in Cape May?"""
    # Let x be the number of shark sightings in Cape May
    # Then, according to the problem, 26 = 5 + 3x
    # Solving for x, we get x = (26-5)/3 = 7
    cape_may_sightings = 7
    result = cape_may_sightings
