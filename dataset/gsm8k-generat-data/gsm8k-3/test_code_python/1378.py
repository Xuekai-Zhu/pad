def solution():
    """Brenda weighs 10 pounds more than 3 times Mel's weight. If Brenda weighs 220 pounds, what is Mel's weight?"""
    # Let's represent Mel's weight as x
    # Then Brenda's weight is 3x + 10
    # We know Brenda weighs 220 pounds, so we can solve for x
    # 220 = 3x + 10
    # 210 = 3x
    # x = 70

    # Therefore, Mel weighs 70 pounds
    result = 70
