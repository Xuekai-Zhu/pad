def solution():
    """Tamara is 3 times Kim's height less 4 inches. Tamara and Kim have a combined height of 92 inches. How many inches tall is Tamara?"""
    # Let's assume Kim's height is x
    # Then Tamara's height is 3x-4
    # And their sum is 92 => x + (3x-4) = 92
    # Solving for x: x = 32
    # Therefore, Tamara's height is 3x-4 = 3*32-4 = 92 inches

    tamara_height = 3 * 32 - 4  # calculating Tamara's height
    result = tamara_height
    return result
