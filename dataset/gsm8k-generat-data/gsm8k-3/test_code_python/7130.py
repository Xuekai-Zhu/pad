Then 5 more people came in and started running on the treadmill and 2 people left. There are now 19 people in the gym. How many people were lifting weights at the start of Bethany’s shift?"""
    # Let's assume x people were lifting weights at the start of Bethany's shift
    # After 5 more people came in and 2 people left, there were 19 people in the gym
    # So, (x + 5) - 2 = 19
    # Simplifying the equation, we get x = 16
    # Therefore, there were 16 people lifting weights at the start of Bethany's shift

    result = 16
