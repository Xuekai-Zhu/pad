def solution():
    """Fifteen more than a quarter of a number is 27. What is the number?"""

    # Let's call the number "x"
    # We know that "15 more than a quarter of x" is 27
    # Mathematically, we can write this as:
    # (1/4)x + 15 = 27

    # We can solve for x by subtracting 15 from both sides and then multiplying by 4
    x = (27 - 15) * 4

    # Simplifying, we get:
    x = 48

    # Therefore, the number is 48
    result = x
    return result
