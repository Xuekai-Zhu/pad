def solution():
    """Jean has three times as much money as Jane. They have a combined total of $76. How much money does Jean have?"""
    # Let x be the amount of money Jane has
    # Then Jean has 3x amount of money
    # Their combined total is $76
    # So we have the equation x + 3x = 76
    # Simplifying it, we have 4x = 76
    # Therefore x = 19, which is the amount of money Jane has
    # Jean has 3 times that, which is 57
    result = 57
    return result
