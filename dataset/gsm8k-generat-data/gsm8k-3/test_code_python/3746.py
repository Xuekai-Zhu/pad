def solution():
    """A pen and pencil have a total cost of $6. If the pen costs twice as much as the pencil, what is the cost of the pen?"""
    # Let x be the cost of the pencil
    # Then the cost of the pen is 2x
    # The total cost is $6
    # Therefore, x + 2x = $6
    # Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = $6
    # Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = $2
    # Therefore, the cost of the pen is 2*$2 = $4

    # Display the cost of the pen
    result = 4
    return result
