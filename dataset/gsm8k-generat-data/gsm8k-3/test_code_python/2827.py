    # Let's assume the current age of the hospital is X.
    # In five years, Grant will be 25 + 5 = 30 years old.
    # According to the problem, in five years, Grant will be 2/3 the age of the hospital, so the age of the hospital in five years will be (2/3) * (30) = 20.
    # Therefore, the current age of the hospital is X = 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

    # Display the current age of the hospital
