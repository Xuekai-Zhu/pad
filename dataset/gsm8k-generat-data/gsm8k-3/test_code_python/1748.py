def solution():
    """Jeff is collecting matchbox cars. He has twice as many cars as trucks. He has 60 total vehicles. How many trucks does he have?"""
    # Let x be the number of trucks
    # Then the number of cars is 2x
    # The total number of vehicles is x + 2x = 3x
    # We know that the total number of vehicles is 60, so 3x = 60
    # Solving for x, we get x = 20

    # Therefore, Jeff has 20 trucks
    result = 20
