    # Let Antonio's age be x
    # Isabella is twice as old as Antonio, so her age is 2x
    # In 18 months, Isabella will be 10 years old, or 120 months old
    # So currently, Isabella is 120 - 18 = 102 months old
    # We can set up an equation to solve for Antonio's age in months
    # 2x = 102
    # x = 51

    # So Antonio is currently 51 months old
