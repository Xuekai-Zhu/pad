def solution():
    """In 5 years, Heath will be 3 times as old as Jude.  If Heath is 16 years old today, how old is Jude today?"""
    # Let's assume Jude's current age is x
    # In 5 years, Heath will be 16+5 = 21 years old
    # In 5 years, Jude's age will be x+5
    # According to the problem, Heath will be 3 times as old as Jude in 5 years
    # Therefore, we can write the following equation:
    # 21 = 3(x+5)
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x = 2
    # Therefore, Jude is currently 2 years old

    result = 2
