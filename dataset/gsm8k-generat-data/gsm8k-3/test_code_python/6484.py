def solution():
    """Gabriel is 3 years younger than Frank. The current total of their ages right now is 17. What is Frank's age?"""
    # Let's use algebra to solve the problem
    # Let x be Frank's age
    # Gabriel's age is then x - 3
    # The total of their ages is 17, so:
    # x + (x - 3) = 17
    # 2x - 3 = 17
    # 2x = 20
    # x = 10

    # Therefore, Frank is 10 years old
    result = 10
