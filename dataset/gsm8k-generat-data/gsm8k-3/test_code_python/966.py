    # Let x be the number of people at Taylor's party
    # Then Ryan's party had 4x people
    # Combined, the parties had x + 4x = 5x people
    # We know that 5x = 240, so x = 48
    # Therefore, Ryan's party had 4x = 192 people

    # Display the number of people at Ryan's party
    result = 192
