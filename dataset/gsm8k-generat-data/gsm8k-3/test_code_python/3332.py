    # Let x be the number of times Jason steps on his partner's feet
    # Then Nancy steps on her partner's feet 3x times
    # Total number of times they step on each other's feet is x + 3x = 4x
    # Given that the total is 32, we have 4x = 32, and x = 8

    # Therefore, Jason steps on his partner's feet 8 times
