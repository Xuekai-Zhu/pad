def solution():
    """Lassie eats half of her bones on Saturday. On Sunday she received 10 more bones. She now has a total of 35 bones. How many bones did she start with before eating them on Saturday?"""
    # Let x be the number of bones Lassie started with
    # After eating half on Saturday, she has x/2 bones left
    # On Sunday, she received 10 more bones, so she has x/2 + 10 bones
    # Given that she now has a total of 35 bones, we can set up the equation:
    # x/2 + 10 = 35
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x = 60
    # Therefore, Lassie started with 60 bones before eating them on Saturday.

    result = 60
