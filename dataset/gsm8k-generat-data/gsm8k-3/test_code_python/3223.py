def solution():
    """There are chickens roaming the chicken farm. The roosters outnumber the hens 2 to 1. If there are 9,000 chickens on the chicken farm, how many roosters are there?"""
    # Let's assume that x is the number of hens on the chicken farm.
    # Then the number of roosters is 2x, as they outnumber the hens 2 to 1.
    # The total number of chickens is the sum of the number of hens and roosters, which is 3x.
    # We know that the total number of chickens is 9,000, so we can set up the equation 3x = 9,000
    # Solving for x gives us x = 3,000, which means there are 2 * 3,000 = 6,000 roosters on the chicken farm.
