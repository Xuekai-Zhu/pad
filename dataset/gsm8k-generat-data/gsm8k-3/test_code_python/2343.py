    # Let x be the number of toy cars Jerome had originally
    # Jerome bought 5 new cars last month, so he had x+5 cars at the end of last month
    # This month he bought twice as many, so he has (x+5) + 2*5 = x+15 cars
    # We know he has 40 cars now, so x+15 = 40
    # Solving for x, we get x = 25
