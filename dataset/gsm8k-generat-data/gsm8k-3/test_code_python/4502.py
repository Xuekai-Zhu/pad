def solution():
    """Arman is six times older than his sister. His sister is 2 years old four years ago. In how many years will Arman's age be 40?"""
    # Define Arman's age as 'a' and his sister's age as 's'
    # Let x be the number of years until Arman's age is 40
    # We have the following two equations:
    # a = 6s
    # a + x = 40
    # We also know that 4 years ago, Arman's sister was 2 years old, so:
    # s - 4 = 2
    # Solving for s, we get s = 6
    # Substituting s = 6 into the first equation, we get a = 36
    # Substituting a = 36 and solving for x, we get x = 4
    # Therefore, Arman's age will be 40 in 4 years
    result = 4
