def solution():
    """Brett has 24 more blue marbles than red marbles. He has 5 times as many blue marbles as red marbles. How many red marbles does he have?"""
    # Let x be the number of red marbles
    # Then the number of blue marbles is x+24

    # According to the problem, the number of blue marbles is 5 times the number of red marbles
    # Therefore, we can write:
    # x+24 = 5x

    # Solving for x, we have:
    # 4x = 24
    # x = 6

    # Therefore, Brett has 6 red marbles
    result = 6
    return result
