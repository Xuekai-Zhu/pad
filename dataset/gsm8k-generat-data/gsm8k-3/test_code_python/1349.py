    """Emerson and his friends love rowing and don't miss the sport on weekends. Starting in the morning, Emerson rowed and was 6 miles away from his starting point on a particular weekend. He continued for another 15 miles at a constant speed, only stopping for a while for rest before covering the remaining 18 miles. What's the total distance covered by Emerson on his trip?"""
