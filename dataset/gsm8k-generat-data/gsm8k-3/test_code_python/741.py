def solution():
    """Angelina is 4 years older than Justin is now. In 5 years, Angelina will be 40 years old. Calculate the age of Justin currently."""

    # Let Justin's age be x
    # Angelina is 4 years older than Justin, so her age is x + 4
    # In 5 years, Angelina will be 40, so her age now is 40 - 5 = 35
    # Therefore, x + 4 = 35
    # Solving for x, we get x = 31

    # Justin is currently 31 years old
    result = 31
