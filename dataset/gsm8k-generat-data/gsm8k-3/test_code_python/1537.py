def solution():
    """Antoinette weighs 7 less kilograms than twice Rupert's weight. Together they weigh 98 kilograms. How many kilograms does Antoinette weigh?"""
    # Let's assume Rupert's weight is x
    # Then Antoinette's weight is 2x - 7
    # And together they weigh 98 kilograms
    # So, x + 2x - 7 = 98
    # Solving for x, we get x = 35.5
    # Therefore, Antoinette's weight is 2x - 7 = 2*35.5 - 7 = 64 kilograms

    antoinette_weight = 2*35.5 - 7

    # Display Antoinette's weight
    result = antoinette_weight
    return result
