def solution():
    
    # Let x be the number of copies sold by Harald
    # Then Marilyn's first record sold 10x copies
    # Their total number of copies sold is x + 10x = 7x
    # We know that 7x = 88000
    # Solving for x, we get x = 16

    # Therefore, Harald sold 16 copies
    result = 16
    return result
