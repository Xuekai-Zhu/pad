def solution():
    
    # Let x be the number of cookies Henry baked last year
    # Then he wants to make twice as many as he did last year
    # We know that he actually baked 15 more cookies than he wanted to, so he baked x + 15 cookies
    # We also drops 5 of his cookies, so he has 110 - 5 = 110
    # Solving for x, we get x = 100

    # Therefore, Henry baked 100 cookies last year
    result = 100
    return result
