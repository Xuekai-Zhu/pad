def solution():
    
    # Let x be Jerry's current age
    # Then, he was 2x - 5 years ago
    # And he was 2x - 5 years ago, so he's age now is 2x - 5 = 2x - 15
    # We know that 3 years in 3 years, so we can set up an equation to solve for x
    x = (2*5 + 15) / 2

    # Display Jerry's age in 3 years
    result = x
    return result
