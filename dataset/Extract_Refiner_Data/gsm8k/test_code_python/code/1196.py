def solution():
    
    # Let x be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge
    # Then, 8 + 4x is the number of coffee mugs
    # We know that 4x + 8 = 40
    # Solving for x, we get x = 16

    # Therefore, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is:
    result = 16
    return result
