def solution():
    
    # Let x be the age of Carly's son
    # Then, the age of Carly's son is 2x - 5
    # We know that the age of Carly's son is 45, so we can write an equation as follows:
    # x + (2x - 5) = 45
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x = (45 + 5) / 2
    # Solving for x, we get:
    # x = (45 + 5) / 2
    # Therefore, Carly's son is 2x - 5 = 75 years old

    # Display Carly's son's age in years
    result = 75
    return result
