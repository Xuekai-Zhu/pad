def solution():
    
    # Let's assume Sara scored 8 points
    # Then Erin scored 3 times more points than Sara
    # So, we have the equation:
    # x + 3x = 8
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 8 / 3

    # The number of points Erin had before scoring 14 points
    result = x
    return result
