def solution():
    
    # Let x be the number of Pokemon caught by Stan
    # Then Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, and Stan has caught 4x - 13
    # The total number of caught Pokemon is x + (4x - 13) = 5x - 13
    # We know that 5x + 13 = 339
    # Solving for x, we get x = 47

    # Therefore, Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 47
    result = 47
    return result
