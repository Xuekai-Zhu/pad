def solution():
    
    # Let x be the amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first
    # Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, so he had x/5 left
    # We know that 3/5 of his land was sold, so he had x/5 left
    # We also know that 12.8 hectares left, so we can write an equation:
    # x + 12.8 = 12.8
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 12.8 / 0.5

    # Display the amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first
    result = x
    return result
