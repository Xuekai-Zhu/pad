def solution():
    
    # Let x be the number of paintings Kim has
    # Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, so Shelley has x - 12 paintings
    # Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, so Shelley has x + 8 paintings
    # Samantha has 27 paintings, so Shelley has 27 - 12 = 12 - 12 = 18 paintings
    # Samantha has 18 paintings, so Shelley has 18 + 8 = 18 + 8 = 23 paintings
    # Samantha has 27 paintings, so Kim has 23 + 18 = 23 + 18 = 23 paintings

    # Display Kim's number of paintings
    result = 23
    return result
