def solution():
    
    # Define the number of toy soldiers and the price per toy
    NUM_TOYS = 12
    PRICE_PER_TOY = 5

    # Calculate the total cost of the toy soldiers
    total_cost = NUM_TOYS * PRICE_PER_TOY / 0.5

    # Calculate the number of toy soldiers that Matthew will pay for $5 per toy
    toy_soldiers_5 = NUM_TOYS / 2

    # Calculate the number of toy soldiers that Matthew will pay for $7 per toy
    toy_soldiers_7 = NUM_TOYS / 2

    # Calculate the total cost of the toy soldiers
    total_cost_7 = toy_soldiers_7 * PRICE_PER_TOY

    # Calculate the total amount Matthew will earn
    total_earnings = total_cost_5 + total_cost_7

    # Display the total earnings
    result = total
