def solution():
    
    # Let x be the age of Bill's father when he saw the Comet
    # Then the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet is 3x
    # The total age of the sun is 75 years, so we have the equation:
    # x + 3x = 75
    # Solving for x, we get:
    x = 75

    # Therefore, Bill saw the Comet for the first time
    result = x
    return result
