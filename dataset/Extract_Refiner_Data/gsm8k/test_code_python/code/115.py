def solution():
    
    # Let x be Lylah's salary
    # Then Adrien's salary was x + 0.375
    # And Adrien's salary was 40% more than what he was making four years ago
    # So, their total salary was x + 0.375 + 0.475 = 40000
    # Simplifying, we get 2x + 0.475 = 40000
    # Solving for x, we get x = 1600

    # Therefore, Lylah's salary was 1600 and Adrien received 4 years later
    result = 1600
    return result
