def solution():
    
    # Define the original price of the mobile device
    original_price = 20

    # Calculate the selling price of each mobile device
    selling_price = original_price * 2

    # Calculate the total cost of buying 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday
    total_cost = 2 * original_price + 4 * selling_price

    # Calculate the profit earned
    profit = total_cost - total_cost

    # return the result
    result = profit
    return result
