def solution():
    separation_of_church_and_state is a complicated issue and there are different interpretations of what it means. However, if we assume that it means keeping God and religion completely out of state matters, then the examples provided suggest that the USA is not fully complying with this principle. 
    The fact that Presidents are sworn in using a Bible and that the country's currency contains religious references are both indications that religion is not entirely separated from state matters. Similarly, the phrase "Under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance can be seen as a religious reference. Therefore, based on these examples, the answer is "yes", the USA fails separation of church and state in multiple ways.
