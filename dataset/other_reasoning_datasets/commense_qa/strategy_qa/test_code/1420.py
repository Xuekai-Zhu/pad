def solution():
    earliest age for childhood amnesia is typically around 2-3 years old
    students in the class of 2017 would have been born in 1999
    therefore, they would have only been 2 years old at the time of 9/11
    it is likely that most, if not all, students would not have a memory of 9/11
    result = "yes"
    return result
