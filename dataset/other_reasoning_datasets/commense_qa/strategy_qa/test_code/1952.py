def solution():
    storks are known to feed on a variety of animals including reptiles, amphibians, animals, and insects. Since the golden toad is an amphibian and storks feed on amphibians, it can be assumed that storks may occasionally feed on golden toads if they are available in their habitat. However, storks do not need golden toads to survive as they have a wide range of prey options. Therefore, the answer is "no".
