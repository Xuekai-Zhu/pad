def solution():
    jpeg_well_suited = False
    if jpeg_well_suited:
        result = "yes"
    else:
        result = "no"
    return result

Note: In this solution, the variable "jpeg_well_suited" is initialized as False, since JPEG is specifically stated as not well suited for line drawings. Therefore, the solution will return "no".
