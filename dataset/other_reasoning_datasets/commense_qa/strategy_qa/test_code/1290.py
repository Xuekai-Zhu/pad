def solution():
    mad_hatter is a milliner
    milliners used mercury to line their hats
    mercury causes poisoning
    succimer is used to treat mercury poisoning
    therefore, it is likely that the milliner in Alice in Wonderland (1951 film) was in need of succimer 
    result = "yes"
    return result
