def solution():
    It is not possible to completely prevent abortion as women have been aborting pregnancies for centuries and will continue to do so even if it is illegal or unsafe. The best way to reduce the need for abortions is through comprehensive sex education and access to safe and effective contraception. Providing support and resources for pregnant women can also reduce the number of abortions by addressing the underlying reasons for choosing to terminate a pregnancy.
