(Note: The solution does not provide a specific answer as the question is asking if Antarctica is a good location for Groundhog Day, and there is no indication if a groundhog is even present in Antarctica. Therefore, the solution just returns "no" as the assumption is that Antarctica is not a suitable location for Groundhog Day.)
