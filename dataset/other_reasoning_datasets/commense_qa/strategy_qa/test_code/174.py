def solution():
    nostradamus_in_hell = False
    if nostradamus_in_hell:
        result = "yes"
    else:
        result = "no"
    return result


Note: This question does not have a clear answer, as it is asking for a hypothetical scenario based on historical context and literary interpretation. Therefore, the solution provided simply returns "no" as there is no evidence to suggest Dante would have placed Nostradamus in the 3rd Circle of Hell.
